Agard \n\nMANY  threads  contribute  to  form  the  com\u00b7 \n\nplex  pattern  of  a  culture-geographical, \nracial,  economic,  political,  scientific,  artistic,  reo \nligious,  and  philosophical,  and,  certainly,  tem\u00b7 \nporal  circumstances.  Some  acquaintance  with \nthis  total  Greek  pattern  is  essential  if  we  are  to \nunderstand  the  values  expressed  in Greek  litera\u00b7 \nture. \n\nA glance at the  map  of Europe  will  reveal the \nstrategic  position  of  Greece.  \"Europa  Minor\"  it \nhas  been  rightly  called.  This  peninsula  is  the \nstepping stone from Asia to Europe; hundreds of \nlittle islands in the Aegean  Sea led the way  from \nthe  home  of  our  earliest  great  cultures  in  Asia \nand Egypt to the mainland  of Europe. Easy com\u00b7 \nmunication by sea was one of the chief geographi\u00b7 \ncal factors  in the  development  of Greece.  Every\u00b7 \nwhere were bays and estuaries, promontories and \nprotecting headlands. And the sea was a friendly \none,  with  no  tides,  no  formidable  distances  be\u00b7 \ntween  landing  places.  The  Mediterranean  is,  in \nfact, a great lake, beautiful as well as useful; poets \nsince Homer have  sung  of its exquisite color, its \njeweled islands  gleaming  as the  sunlight falls  on \ntheir clean, limestone shores. \n\nThe  country  itself  is  composed  of  ridges  of \nmountains,  with  small  valleys  lying  between. \nThese  are  not  vast  mountains;  the  highest  one, \nOlympus,  rises  only  about  10,000  feet.  But  they \ndo  effectively  separate  one  plain  from  another, \nso  that many  settlements  had no  convenient out\u00b7 \nlet except to the coast. \n\nThe  people  who  lived  in  these  surroundings \nfound the climate a favorable one for outdoor ac \ntivity nearly all the year around. Except for a few \nweeks of heavy rainfall in the late autumn, Greece \nis a land of sunlight.  Yet the sun is not often op\u00b7 \npressively  hot;  even  in  summer  the  prevailing \ntrade  winds  blow  steadily  and  keep  the  atmos\u00b7 \nphere from becoming humid. \n\nThe  soil,  however,  has  never  been  favorable \nfor  easy  living.  Fertile  plains  are  few,  and  even \nthere the soil is thin and poor in comparison with \nour river valleys  and Western  plains. Greece  has \nno  rivers of importance;  often  irrigation  had to \nbe resorted to in an effort to make the earth yield \nenough to  support the  people.  On  the low  slopes \nof the hills the chief products were raised:  olives \nand grapes, and Hocks of sheep and goats. Higher \nup  there  were  forests  of  oak  and  chestnut,  then \nbeeches and evergreens, and finally  alpine foliage \nnearer the summits of the mountains. The moun \ntains  contained  scattered  deposits  of  minerals \nsilver,  lead,  zinc,  iron. \n\nInsofar  as  surroundings  influence  human  de \nvelopment  we  might  expect  to  find  in  Greece  a \nhealthy, hard\u00b7working people.  Sunlight and fresh \nbreezes  from  the  sea  and  conditions  rugged \nenough to challenge men's energies are factors in \nmaking  people  healthy  and  enterprising.  We \nwould not expect them to be moody, introspective, \nromantic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6464840c-cfa5-4856-b6d3-ba39b452a33a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6464840c-cfa5-4856-b6d3-ba39b452a33a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 0, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af700820-a5c5-4b2f-8f3b-0deba34438c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 0, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "f9e6ad32537b0db1703465f6db055d420023b5d6613c09f25419db5a34d3c866"}, "2": {"node_id": "48b9bb40-49a3-4f84-b7ee-7f813f0b2326", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 0, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "ac8cf01cba28623ac388c78eeff43a7775f07457aa953f3f524cf28899aa8167"}}, "hash": "56d5ea3ac918309f6461b7aedbfed8592e0094c8a3df7b98b49121c3fc77d018", "text": "An  environment characterized by clear \noutlines,  sharp,  vivid  colors,  and  well\u00b7defined \nforms  does  not usually  produce either  mysticism \nor  morbidness.

About  that  date  there \ncarne into the peninsula wave after wave of nomad \ntribes  from  the  north;  a  robust,  youthful  race \nof  Alpine  type,  splendid  fighters,  with  a  Ian\u00b7 \nguage,  religion,  and  social  organization  which \nwere  to  form  the  basis  of  later  Greek  culture. \nIt  was  from  the  amalgamation  of  the  Mediter\u00b7 \nranean  people  and  these  northerners  that  the \nGreek people whom we shall study emerged. How \nthe tribes of Ionians and Achaeans profited from \nthe Mediterranean  influences,  especially those  of \nthe  flourishing  civilization  centering  in  Crete,  is \nobvious  from  the  remains  unearthed  by  excava\u00b7 \ntors  in  such  settlements  as  Mycenae  and  Pylos. \nDuring  such  a  restless  age  of  migration  and \nconquest,  warfare  was  of  course  the  leading  ac \ntivity.  Military  prowess  was  the  characteristic \nwhich  made  men  respected;  kings  like  Achilles, \nAgamemnon,  and  Odysseus  were  their  people's \nheroes.  After  the  centuries  of  fighting  subsided, \nstories  of the  great days  of conquest  were  popu \nlar  among  the  princes  and  nobles  of the  newly \nsettled  cities,  especially  on  the  coast  of  Asia \nMinor,  and  professional  bards  went  from  court \nto  court  singing  the  traditional  accounts  of  bat \ntles. For a long time these songs  were not written \ndown  because  writing  was  as  yet  unknown;  but \nultimately certain selections were chosen by poets \nand  fused  into  more  or less  unified  poems.  The \nIliad remains as one of these works. The Odyssey \nwas  similarly  composed,  probably  rather  later, \nfrom  legends,  folklore,  and  fictional  elements \ncentering around the exploration  of  the Mediter \nranean and early commercial ventures. \n\n\"The  world  described  by  Horner  is  one  of ad-\n\nventure,  of war  and plunder, of the  allegiance of \nfighting  men  to  their  leaders.  The  tribe,  com \nposed of many clans, is the basic institution;  it is \nled by a king, but the leaders of the clans form a \ncouncil  of  nobles  whom  he consults,  and  all  the \npeople  meet  in  assembly  to  hear  the  policies  ex \nplained  and  voice  their  opinion  regarding  them. \nAgriculture  is  the  chief  means  of  peaceful  sub \nsistence;  land  belongs to  the tribe and is tempo \nrarily allotted to its~embers. Industry and com \nmerce  are  in  a  primitive  stage.  The  principal \namusements  are  banquets,  athletic  meets,  and \nlistening to the recital of poets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9907981-1122-4f65-aa70-7a100d2dc006": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9907981-1122-4f65-aa70-7a100d2dc006", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e4723d2-ab5b-43e2-b737-767f031893ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "9bef9ed444106124029d634a9487346171ca7a4593d224c5e732cd6f4630dca2"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b5c4932-92d9-4498-a8dd-91cb6750dd40", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 1, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "22192cc3096ebd853cbca06d58b11e7e15457e162415520fb4c1d14da04a9d73"}}, "hash": "1585695559126eaa5952678dfef6fb22b9a7bf3068e48e4d6a65bce4f0822d21", "text": "The ethics of war \nare enlightened:  men  who  fight  part \"reconciled \nin friendship\";  there are truces for  the burial of \nthe dead;  poisoned arrows are taboo;  respect for \nthemselves  and  for  others  saves  these  fighters \nfrom  much  of  the  cruelty  associated  with  war \nfare.

The  eco \nnomic  distress  of the farmers  was  partly met  by \na colonization movement which relieved the over \npopulation  at home  and  opened  new  sources  of \nsupply  and  markets  all  over  the  Mediterranean_ \nIt was  a  period  of  the  rise  of the  common  man_ \nSolon's  reforms  in  Athens  gave  the  people  new \neconomic  security  and  political  and  judicial \npowers of such importance that he has justly been \ncalled  \"the father  of  democracy.\"  The  power  of \nthe  nobles  was  undermined  by  unconstitutional \nrulers  called  tyrants,  who  relied  upon  popular \nsupport for  their success.  In those years of com \nparative peace, commerce and the arts flourished. \nAthletic  games,  local  and  international,  were \nestablished,  along with  artistic and religious  fes \ntivals;  architects,  sculptors,  and  vase-painters \nwere  active;  poets  wrote  with  the  enthusiasm  of \nfreedom,  and  men  began  for  the  first  time  fear\u00b7 \nlessly  to  speculate  on  the  nature of the  physical \nworld.  This cultural flowering  was  most  marked \nin the Ionian cities of Asia Minor, in the islands, \nand at Athens. \n\nThe final episode of the pioneer period was the \nrepulse of Persia. The  one serious menace to the \nfurther  development  of  Greece  lay  in  the  exten\u00b7 \nsion  of  the  great  Persian  Empire  to  the  islands \nand  continental  Greece.  Few  chapters in  history \nare  more  stirring  than  that  of Herodotus  which \ntells  of  the  Greek  refusal  to  submit  to  Persia's \ndemands and of the almost incredible victories at \nMarathon and Salamis. The Greek cities emerged \nfrom  the  trial  confident  of  their  own  powers, \nready to build on the foundation laid by pioneers \nthe splendid structure of maturity. \n\nIt was the Athenian navy which played the lead\u00b7 \ning  role  in  the  defeat  of  Persia,  and  during  the \nfifth  century  Athens  became  the  dominant  city \nof Greece in political and economic power and in \ncultural  leadership.  Profiting  from  the  Spartan \npolicy  of  isolation,  Athens  assumed  the  leader\u00b7 \n\nship  of the  Delian  Confederacy,  a league of over \ntwo hundred Greek cities formed to protect them. \nselves from further Persian aggression. Gradually \nthis league became virtually an Athenian Empire. \nAthens, at home  devoted to freedom and individ\u00b7 \nuality,  refused  to  allow  her  subject  states  the \nsame rights that she herself enjoyed. Sparta, auto \ncratic and repressive of minorities at home,  real\u00b7 \nized  the danger  to  herself  and her  allies  of such \npower  in the hands  of a  democratic government, \nand proclaimed herself the champion of the rights \nof  small  states.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e34ffa2f-7d91-41e8-a0e3-11f909b6bc8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e34ffa2f-7d91-41e8-a0e3-11f909b6bc8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "982cf714-5d51-404e-9f07-8d535186905c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "ff2d1787465adf689aea269a30c96bb0c793a2f49810479b7f1b648977c0f660"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ff42c03-6f72-40dc-a4e8-779378da7a67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 2, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "37312e7418201d28795d3b12eda9617bccd345e7ccfa474ce534dd4234ca70b4"}}, "hash": "882a2109124eb7d8f4088234291967eee3d3bb3e37fc64a0f04044346298adc5", "text": "Corinth,  formerly  the  leading \ncommercial  city,  saw  her  trade  being  strangled \nby  Athens.

Thereafter  Greece \nbecame simply  a part of the  Roman  Empire.  But \nif Rome won  the military victory, Greece  was  the \ncultural  conqueror.  Wealthy  Romans  sent  their \nsons to Athens for their education; Greek teachers \nand artists were summoned to  Italy;  Greek archi \ntecture  and  sculpture,  literature,  religion,  and \nphilosophy  were  adopted  by the  Romans.  Across \nEurope,  Asia,  and  Africa,  where  Roman  power \nextended, the culture of Greece spread. The seeds \nfrom  the  dying  tree  of  Hellas  were  scattered  to \nthe  four  winds,  to  sprout  into  new  life  all  over \nthe  world. \n\nTHE  STAGE  has  been  set,  and  we  have  reviewed \nthe  bare  outlines  of  the  plot  of  Greek  develop \nment.  It  remains  to  do  something  much  more \nimportant:  to  discover,  if  we  can,  the  motives \nand  aims  of  the  characters,  to  understand  the \nforces that shaped their evolution.  What were the \nsocial conditions  under  which  they  lived?  What \nenjoyment did they find  in life?  What were their \nviews  of  the  nature  of  the  world  and  of  man? \nThese  are  the  questions  we  must  now  ask  about \nthe  Greeks,  especially  those  who  created  the \nflower  of  Greek  civilization  in  fifth- and  fourth \ncentury Athens_ \n\nIn economic institutions we  shall find probably \nthe most striking difference  between  that ancient \nand  our modern  life. The Greeks were living in a \nworld  infinitely  simpler  and  less  complicated  in \nthis respect than our own. It was a world of handi \ncraft  rather  than  the  machine,  of  limited  re \nsources,  of  small-scale  production,  modest  com \npetition and advertising, and the mere beginnings \nof  a  banking  and  credit  system.  The 'enormous \ncreation  and  exploitation  of  wealth  which  have \nbeen  developed  since  the  Industrial  Revolution \nwere  undreamed  of.  And  the  consequent  stand \nards,  whereby  we  judge  men's  happiness  in \nterms  of  material  conveniences  and  men's  pres \ntige in terms of financial success, were also largely \nforeign to Greece. It may seem to us the strangest \ndifference of all that in fifth\u00b7century  Athens men \nwere  highly  civilized  without  being  what  we \nwould  call  comfortable,  and  that  many,  perhaps \nmost,  of  the  citizens  regarded  \"business\"  as  less \nimportant  than  politics. \n\nThe population  of Athens  in  430  B.C.  has been \nestimated  as  around  425,000  including  adult \nmales  as  follows:  citizens,  40,000;  resident \n\naliens,  25,000;  slaves,  55,000.

In  order  to  provide  goods  for  ex \nchange, many industries had been developed dur \ning  the  sixth  century-pottery,  textiles,  leather \ngoods, jewelry-so that Athens became a thriving \nindustrial  and  commercial  center, \nimporting \nworkers  from  abroad  and  protecting  with  her \nnavy  the  vital  trade  route  to  the  Black  Sea.  But \njudged  by  modern  standards  the  industry  and \ncommerce  were  of  a  very  simple  sort.  Individual \ncraftsmen  had  their  little  shops,  seldom  employ \ning  more  than  half  a  dozen  assistants;  contracts \nwere  made,  but  without  much  formality;  there \nwere  no  fixed  prices,  little  credit,  no  system  of \ncompetitive  bargaining,  no  advertising  cam \npaigns.

Such  ways  of  doing  business  en \ncouraged  caution  and  resulted  in  economic  con \nservatism. \n\nMuch  of this  business  was  gladly  entrusted  to \nforeigners  and  slaves;  the  Athenian  citizens  in \nsisted  on  as  much  time  as  they  could  afford  for \npolitics  and  sports,  festivals  and  conversation, \nwhich  they  greatly  preferred  to  being  cramped \nover  a bench or an office desk.  Yet they must not \nbe  thought  of  as  a  leisure\u00b7class  people.  Only  a \nsmall  percentage  of  them  did  not  have  to  work \nfor  a  living,  on  farm  or  in  factory,  and  fully \nhalf of  the  citizens were  what we  would  call day \nlaborers.

Duties \nwere  levied  on exports  and  imports;  a  bureau of \nstandards kept  strict  watch  of  weights  and meas \nures  and  the  purity  of  goods;  the  coinage  was \nnever  debased.  For  running  expenses  the  city \nrelied  upon money  from  fines  and  revenues from \nstate  property,  such  as  the  silver  mines.  The  ob \nligation  to  workers  and  the  families  of  soldiers \nwas  recognized;  doles  were  paid  to  disabled \nworkmen, grants were provided so that the poorer \ncitizens could  spare time  from  their work to par \nticipate  in  political  activity  and  festivals,  and \nthe  orphans  of  men  killed  in  war  received  pen \nsions. \n\nResident  aliens  were  restricted  in  the  owner \nship  of  land,  but  otherwise  they  were  allowed \nto  profit  in  every  way  from  being  in  Athens. \nMany  of  the  foremost  artisans  and  professional \nand businessmen in the city were foreigners.  The \nrestrictions  imposed  on  slaves  (chiefly  war  cap \ntives)  were,  of  course,  much  greater.  The  less \ngifted among them were consigned to the hardest \nof  tasks,  such  as  mining,  or  were  sold  to  in \ndividuals  for  work  in  homes  or  factories.  The \nabler  ones  were  given  state  jobs  as  artisans  on \npublic  work  projects,  clerks,  or  members  of  the \npolice  force.  There  they  wore  no  distinguishing \ndress  or brand,  could  become  foremen  directing \ncitizens  if  their  talents  warranted,  received  the \nsame  pay  as  free  workers,  and  could  often  save \nfrom  it enough  to  buy  their  freedom.  Obviously \nthese  are  not  the  economic  conditions  usually \nassociated  with  slavery.

They  were \ntaught  reading,  writing,  and  arithmetic,  but  the \nchief  attention  was  given  to  the  memorizing  of \npoetry,  playing  the  lyre,  and  gymnastics.  The \nstories  of  heroes  were  supposed  to  inspire  boys \nto  copy their courage,  ingenuity, and devotion to \nthe  public  welfare;  the  rhythm  and  harmony  of \nmusic  were  believed  to  \"penetrate  into  the  in\u00b7 \nward places of the soul and affect it powerfully\"; \nthe  physical  education  aimed  to  develop  enduro \nance,  skill,  and  sound  coordination  of  body  and \nmind.

But  he  never  took  money  for  his \nteaching,  and he never pretended to answer ques\u00b7 \ntions  for  his  followers.  His mission  was  to  start \npeople  thinking  for  themselves,  even  on  such \ndangerous  subjects  as  religion  and  government. \nIt is not strange that he became highly unpopular \nduring the later years  of the  Peloponnesian  War \nand  was  eventually  put to  death  as  a  subversive \ncitizen.

The analysis  of  a  few  of  them  will \ngive us the clue to their greatness. \n\nWhen  we  examine  Greek  buildings  they  seem \nrather  simple.  The  plan  is  usually  a  rectangular \nmass,  crowned  with  a  gable  roof  and  relying  on \nrows  of  columns  for  its  chief  effect.  Sometimes \nthe  form  is  circular;  occasionally,  as  in  the \nErechtheum,  it  is  irregular,  but  there  is  never \nany intricacy of essential design.  Simplicity is  its \nfirst  characteristic.  But  as  we  study  more  in  de \ntail the architecture of the Greeks we  find  it is by \nno means  as simple  as  we  would  at first  suppose. \nContent  with  a  piflin  essential  form,  the  Greeks \ninvested  it  with  subtle  refinement  and  variety \nwhich made it a living and glowing thing. \n\nWhen  we  look  at  the  Parthenon,  for  example, \nwe  are  impressed  first  of  all  by  its  outward sim \nplicity  and  dignity, \nits  logical  construction, \nplanned  with a  mathematically exact relationship \nof  the  various  parts.  But  it  is  not  a  cold  and \nmechanical  simplicity.  The  lines  are  not  abso \nlutely horizontal and  vertical;  they  are delicately \ncurved,  so  that  the  flexibility  of  life  is  in  them. \nThe  base  across  the  front  rises  in  the  center \nnearly  three  inches,  and  is  slightly  convex;  the \ncourse over  the  columns  has  a  slightly  backward \nslope,  and  the  cornice  above  bends  gently  out \nward;  the  side  walls  slope  in  toward  the  top. \nThe columns diminish  in diameter as they mount \nupward,  with  a  slight  swelling  about  a  third  of \nthe  way  up.  They are fluted,  so  that the  shadows \ncast  upon  them  repeat  their  curves  and  empha \nsize their mass as well as their grace. The capitals \nare  also  complex  in  their  calculated  proportions \nand  curvatures.  Furthermore  there  is  decoration \nlavishly  applied  to  the  nonstructural  parts  of \nthe  building;  the  pediments  and  metopes  are \nfilled  with  a  rich  variety  of  sculptured  figures, \nand  the  dividing  lines  between  the various  parts \nof  the  building  are  marked  and  the  transitions \nsoftened by elaborate mouldings. This decoration \nwas  not  merely  in  cold  stone;  glowing  red  and \nblue  color  was  applied  to  the  sculpture  and  the \nmouldings  to  relieve  the  eye  from  the  glare  of \nmarble  under  a  hot  southern  sky  and  to  add  to \nthe vitality of the whole effect. \n\nOf course  temples  were  not  the  only  buildings \n\nerected  by  the  Greeks,  although  on  them  they \nexpended  most  of  their  time  and  (\"are.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cc3bcbd-434e-46dd-ac51-1a5638d77882": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cc3bcbd-434e-46dd-ac51-1a5638d77882", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 6, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1efcbdd-c4e3-43a0-8bac-3c60b378e078", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 6, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "acaa2677d40bcf12857862066ae95dda6f3ff44cc980df99fd1828a193ca320b"}, "2": {"node_id": "eceb0c1e-d57a-43be-bda3-08a40394a89b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 6, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "f24b5d0cdd2fbc0a739af6eda7470a734d3eb9b3e3d846dc65993bf2f07e9fa5"}}, "hash": "42c7c30de41be84a41a2d1b53abc946000db6697473ed400e1896781073dca2f", "text": "Their \nhouses  were  of  the  simplest  sort  still  popular  in \nMediterranean  lands,  boxlike  affairs  with  an  in \nterior  colonnade  around  a  central  court  which \nwas open to the sky.

Sculpture  was  a leading  art to  the Greeks. \nThey  were  by  nature  people  who  liked  to  live  in \na  world  of  clear-cut  forms,  practical  and  intel \nlectual  as  well  as  aesthetic.  So  we  find  sculpture \nflourishing  throughout  Greek  history  as  a  popu \nlar  community  expression.  On  their  buildings \nwere  scenes  commemorating  the  founding  of \ntheir  cities  and  their  ancient triumphs  in  battle; \nin  their  temples  and  shrines  were  statues  repre \nsenting  their  gods;  after  the  festivals  and  ath \nletic  games  monuments  were  erected  to  the  vic \ntors.  Sculptors  were  regarded  as  normal  and \nnecessary  contributors \nthe  national  life; \nsculptural rivalry  was  often  as keen  as  athletic or \ndramatic competition;  and the masters of the art, \nlike  Phidias  and  Praxiteles,  were  held  in  the \nhighest  honor.  Since sculpture  was  50  closely  re \nlated  to  the  life  of  the  people,  its  development \nnaturally  corresponds  to  the  evolution  of  the \nGreek  character.  In  the  pioneer  period there was \npioneer  sculpture, crude but vigorous,  done with \nthe sap  and  savor  of  youth.  By  the  fifth  century \nthe  same  poise  and  harmony  was  attained  in  the \nParthenon  figures  that  characterized  in  other \nways  the  Golden  Age.  Then,  as  individualism \nspread  during  the  feverish  period  of  the  Greek \nwars,  sculpture  became  less  a  community  than  a \nprivate  affair;  personal  portraits  and  romantic \ngroups  succeeded  the  monumental  and  idealistic \nsculpture of the  earlier day.  During the  Hellenis \ntic  period,  genre  scenes  from  ordinary  life  be \ncame  popular,  sentimentalism  ran  riot,  and  dra \nmatic  episodes  were emphasized. \n\nThe  greatness  of  Greek  sculpture  in  its  best \nperiod,  from  about  500  to  300  B.C.,  is  to  be \nunderstood in terms of  its meeting four standards \nwhich  apply  to  all  great sculpture.

The  third  standard  is  that \nof  design.  Here  the  logical  bent  of  the  Greeks \nis  clear  in  their  creation  of  delightfully  bal\u00b7 \nanced  forms.  Finally,  in  their  expression  of \nfigures  in  three  dimensions,  one  contour merges \ninto  another,  the  design  develops  and  changes, \nand  a  total  impression  of  balance  and  harmony \nin depth  is  realized.  The concentration  of energy \nand  power  in  Greek  sculpture  is  nonetheless  po \ntent  because  it  is  expressed  with  a  breadth  of \nmodeling  which  keeps  it  from  becoming  fussy \nand trivial. \n\nTo  THE  Greeks  the  drama  was  much  more  than \nan  amusing  spectacle;  it was  rooted  in  religious \ntradition.  It  dealt  with  urgent  problems  of  in \ndividual  and social  experience  and  offered  intel \nlectual  and  moral  as  well  as  aesthetic  interpre\u00b7 \ntations  of  life.  Everyone  expected  to  see  the \nplays  during  the  great  religious  festivals;  they \nwere produced by  the community, and the actors \nwere  respected  as  important  contributors  to  the \ncity's  life. \n\nThe  sheer  spectacle  appealed  to  the  Greeks; \ntheir  drama  resembled  our  grand  opera  as  well \nas  our  plays.  Between  the  episodes  of  action  a \nin  many\u00b7colored  costumes  danced  to \nchorus \nmusic  the  emotional  interpretation  of  what  had \nhappened;  the characters were  dressed,  and they \nspoke  and  moved,  in  a  manner  above  that  of \nordinary life;  often a god was introduced toward \nthe  end  to  heighten  the  spectacular  effect.  But \nessentially  the  tragedies  had  to  do  with  themes \ninvolving  the  conflicts  between  individuals,  be\u00b7 \ntween  individuals  and  social  forces,  or  between \nindividuals  and  that  universal  force  which  was \ncalled  Necessity  or  Destiny.  Aeschylus  was \nespecially  concerned  with  the  operation  of  the \nmoral  law  in  its  historical  evolution,  Sophocles \nwith  the  conflict between  men  and social  institu \ntions,  Euripides  with  the  struggle  of  will  and \nemotion  between  individuals. \n\nComedies  were  also  part of the  great city  fes \ntivals.  The  greatest  writer  of  these  plays,  Aris-\n\ntophanes,  was  first  of  all  a  robust  and  hearty \ncomedian,  using  all  the  tricks  of his  trade:  out \nlandish  speech,  caricature,  impossible  situations \nfollowing  one  another  at  breakneck  speed,  and \nfantasy.

Yet it seems a strange religion, with \nits scores of great and lesser gods, corresponding \nto  all  sorts of natural phenomena  and aspects  of \nhuman  experience,  its  lack  of  any  sacred  book \nor  powerful  priests,  its  richly  imaginative  and \ninconsistent  mythology,  its  general  disregard  of \ndogma  and  ethical  precepts.  The  gods,  to  most \nGreeks,  were  not  distinguished  by  their  moral \ngreatness but by their superhuman power, beauty, \nand  immortality.  As  administrators  of  Destiny \nthey  could  control  the  affairs  of  men,  so  they \nwere  to  be  treated  with  deference  and  respect, \nworshipped  with  prayer and sacrifice. But it was \nritual  rather than  dogma  or ethics  which  was  at \nthe  heart  of  Greek  religion.  Every  citizen  ex\u00b7 \npected  to  offer  sacrifices  to  the  friendly  gods  of \nhis  farm  and his home;  to  cunning Hermes if he \nengaged in trade; to  Poseidon if he went on a sea \nvoyage;  to  Hephaestus  if he  was  an  artisan.  Be \nfore  battle  an  Athenian  prayed  to  Athena  Pro\u00b7 \nmachos,  the  defender  of the  city,  who  was  also, \nas  Athena  Parthenos,  the  virgin  goddess  of  ad \nministrative  sagacity.  Artemis  was  the  patron  of \nhunters  and  the  helper  of  women  in  childbirth. \nThe  god  of  health,  patron  of  the  arts  and \nprophecy,  was  Apollo.  Ares  was  the  universal \nGreek god of warfare, Hera the domestic divinity, \n\n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/2/2023 1:35 PM via UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO.

To  these  gods,  in \nthroughout  the  year,  the \nscores  of  festivals \nGreek  cities gave their tribute of praise and  sup \nplication;  in their  honor  processions,  songs,  and \ngames  were  held;  temples  were  built  to  please \nthem,  and  burnt  offerings  smoked  on  the  altars. \nOne consolation  of religion  these  gods  did  not \nprovide:  the  assurance  of  a  blessed  immortality. \nThis assurance many Greeks found in the worship \nof  other  divinities,  notably  Demeter  and  Di \nonysus.  Demeter  was  worshipped  in  the  sacra \nments of the Eleusinian Mysteries, which included \nthe  washing  away  of  impurity  and  witnessing  a \nsymbolic  representation  of  the  resurrection  of \nnew  life.  In  ecstatic  dances  the  followers  of \nDionysus  lost  their consciousness  of  self  and felt \nthe  divine  madness  of  sharing  in  the  experience \nof the god of the Spring rebirth of nature. \n\nThe  general  effect  of  Greek  religion  was \nhealthy, picturing  as  it did  a  world  governed by \nrational and lovely  beings,  who  were  worshipped \nin  correspondingly  beautiful  rituals.  It  was  also \na  religion  of  tolerance,  which  imposed  few  re \nstrictions  upon  the  human  mind  in  the  form  of \ndogma  and  creed.  For social ethics,  however,  the \nGreek relied on the institution which had religion \nin  its  keeping:  the  community  itself. \n\nThere  were,  however,  among  poets  and  phi \nlosophers  many  who  believed  that  religion  and \nmorality cannot be divorced, that the forces which \ncontrol  our  world  are one  in  character,  and  that \ncharacter is  goodness.  Euripides and Plato  agree \nin  condemning stories about the gods  which  pic \nture  them  as  less  moral  than  men.  Socrates  de \nclared  that  God  is  responsible,  not  for  the  evil \nin  the  world,  but  only  for  the  good.  Aeschylus \npreached  of  a,  moral  law  which  controls  men's \ndestiny. The Stoics  believed that reason  rules the \nuniverse,  in  accordance  with  which  one  must  be \na  brother  to  all  men. \n\nMany  other  Greeks  were  not  content  with  the \nreligious  interpretations of the world which  were \nsufficient  for  the  rank  and  file.  As  early  as  the \nsixth  century  B.C.,  scientists  began  to  speculate \nregarding  the  nature  of  the  world,  enquiring  of \nwhat substance it is composed, by what processes \nthat substance takes  the  forms  which  we  see, and \nwhat  is  the  explanation  of  energy_  Within  the \n\nfollowing  two  hundred  years  Greeks  stated  the \natomic theory, the theory of evolution, many cor \nrect  principles  of  astronomy  and  mathematics, \nand  methods  of  scientific  medicine. \n\nEven \n\ntwo  respects,  however, \n\nWe  must,  however,  make  two  important  dis \ntinctions  between  Greek  science  and  our  own.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "764a8786-910e-40bc-9251-92b22af7c239": {"__data__": {"id_": "764a8786-910e-40bc-9251-92b22af7c239", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f7b259a-9818-429e-9189-3cd9b63170d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "239e67c7324cf98c7554c62580e8d51e2dd16c6fa65d3e6971d5c867b321a143"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb011c47-44e5-43ca-b963-94caeac1e4a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 8, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "cf9a66bd2622c09c3468e888e1588f3ca1aa0962eea72d215a3adeb420c0e241"}}, "hash": "c444d6575ff3ca210eaf7170fcc9e48d28a2d6ff2890d99fafd1094fa0efb429", "text": "First, the Greek discoveries  were  largely brilliant \nguesswork,  deductive  rather  than  experimental, \non  the  part  of  a  few  men;  secondly,  their  dis \ncoveries  were  for  the  most  part  theoretical,  and \nwere  seldom  applied  practically  to  make  living \nconditions  more  convenient. \nin  these \n\nthe \nGreeks  had  outstanding  exceptions  to  the  gen \neral  rule.

Brown \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nTHE  SEVENTH  and  sixth  centuries  B.C.  saw  the  composi \ntion  of  the  Homeric  Hymns-poems  in  the  meter  and \nlanguage  of  Homer  dealing  with  episodes  in the  careers \nof  the  Olympian  gods.  The  Homeric  Hymn  to  Hermes \n(written  in the  sixth  century)  is  a  fine  example  of  this \nmythological  poetry  in  the  archaic  Greek  style.  It  tells \nhow  the impudent  upstart  Hermes  obtains equality with \nhis  august  and  noble  brother Apollo.  The humor  of the \nstory,  judged by  Hebraic-Christian  notions of the divine, \nis blasphemous;  but in Greek religion of the archaic age, \ngods  are  anthropomorphio-and  therefore  often  comical \n\n-without  ceasing  to  be  gods.  The  sympathies  of  the \nauthor are on  Hermes'  side: Apollo is the aristocrat,  rich \nin cattle;  Hermes, the god of merchants, by a combination \nof technical  ingenuity, shrewdness, and unscrupulousness \n\"makes good\" on the very day of  his birth and  cheats the \nelder god. \n\nFOR  A  further  discussion  of  the  hymn,  see  Norman  O. \nBrown,  Hermes  the  Thiet  (Madison,  Wis.,  1947), Chap \nters V and VI. The text translated is that of  T_  W.  Allen, \nHomeri Opera  (Oxford, 1911), Vol. V. \n\nA HYMN to Hermes, Muse, to Hermes the son  of \nZeus and Maia, the lord of Mount Cyllene and of \nArcadia and its flocks  of sheep, the messenger of \nthe gods.  Maia, the good  nymph  with  the beauti \nful hair, gave birth to him after her union in love \nwith  Zeus.  She  lived  in  the  shady  depths  of  a \ncave,  to  avoid  the company  of the blessed  gods; \nthere  Zeus,  the  son  of  Cronus,  used  to  lie  with \nher in the dead  of night, for  as long as the sweet \nchains  of slumber  held  Hera,  his  wife  with  the \nwhite  limbs;  and  he  kept  it secret from  the  im \nmortal  gods  and  from  mortal  men.  When  the \ntime  had  come  to  fulfill  the  purpose  of  great \nZeus,  and  her tenth  month had  risen  in the sky, \nshe  brought  the  infant  forth  into  the  light,  and \ndeeds of signal note ensued. Then it was she gave \nbirth  to  that  ingenious  child,  that  cunning \nschemer,  that  raider  and  rustler  of  cattle,  the \nshepherd  of  dreams,  that  denizen  of  night  who \nloiters  in  doorways.  It did  not take  him long  to \nprove his prowess to the immortal gods.  Born in \nthe morning, in the noonday he performed upon \nthe  lyre,  in  the  evening  he  stole  the  cattle  of \nthe  archer-god  Apollo-all  on  that  first  fourth \nday of the month that the lady Maia gave birth to \nhim. \n\nAs soon as he leaped from the immortal thighs \nof his  mother,  he  did  not  lie long  in  the  sacred \nwinnowing  basket  that  was  his  cradle;  instead \nhe jumped up, and was off in search of the cattle \nof Apollo.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69ee68cb-363b-46f3-909a-d97371d4c2de": {"__data__": {"id_": "69ee68cb-363b-46f3-909a-d97371d4c2de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 10, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abdc6c4f-71e4-44c8-94cd-7603a818214e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 10, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "5e91524451cdfd14f97ed56d58755e8c28b80d200aca4c67a137ae8299a77c29"}, "2": {"node_id": "e25eb9f7-e01c-47b3-8fab-5dada0f180b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 10, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "7234ed6a431cc6efa9586b8f0c9ff1e4efac14cf3a22dfdb0fa9f921df37d30f"}}, "hash": "801312a780a569fa2759285ad44feb355ae648560336f81c1e50982d6c3c914c", "text": "As  he stepped  across the threshold  of \nthe  high-overarched  cave,  he  discovered  a  tor \ntoise,  from  which  he  made  an  immense  fortune: \nit was Hermes who  first made the tortoise into a \nsinger.

When  it was  all made,  he \ntook  the  lovely  toy  and  struck  up  a  melody;  in \nhis  hands  the  tortoise  raised  a  stirring  din.  The \ngod sang a pretty song in  accompaniment, trying \nhis skill  at improvising,  as  young  men  revelling \nin  their  cups  improvise  impudent  sallies  of  wit; \nhis  subject  was  Zeus,  the  son  of  Cronus,  and \nMaia  of  the  beautiful  sandal,  how  they  used  to \ndally  in  companionate  love,  and  his  own  birth; \nhe  even  cited  his  own  name.

From  this  herd  the \nson  of  Maia,  the  keen-eyed  killer  of  Argus,  cut \noff  fifty  cows.

Then Hermes in cheer\u00b7 \nful  spirits  spread  the  rich  harvest  on  a  smooth \nslab,  and  divided  it  into  twelve  portions  which \nhe  assigned by lot;  each  portion  had a choice cut \nof  honor  added  to  it.  Noble  Hermes  felt  a  desire \nfor the sacred offerings of meat: immortal though \nhe  was,  the good  smell  tempted him;  nevertheless \nhis  manly soul did  not yield,  in  spite  of  his great \nlonging to stuff his holy throat. Instead he carried \nit  all-the  meat  and  fat-into  the  cave  with  its \nlofty  roof and  placed  it away  up  high, as a monu\u00b7 \nment to  his  recent  theft.  Then,  adding  dry  wood \nto  the  fire,  he  destroyed  the  rest-the  feet  and \nheads-in  the  blaze.  When  all  his  business  had \nbeen  finished,  the  god  threw  his  sandals  into  the \ndeep  current  of  the  Alpheus,  extinguished  the \nembers and sprinkled the spot with  black dirt; all \nnight  he  worked,  and  the  beautiful  light  of  the \nJady  Moon  shone  down  on  him. \n\nHe  arrived  back  at the  sacred  peak  of  Cyllene \nat dawn;  on the long way  he encountered no one, \nneither  of  the  blessed  gods  nor  of  mortal  men; \nnor  did  the  dogs  bark.

There  the  archer-god \nfound  the tracks,  and  exclaimed:  \"Heavens, here \nis  a  very  strange  thing  that  I  see  with  my  own \neyes.

I  have  seen  nothing;  I \nhave heard nothing;  no one has told me anything. \nI  cannot  inform  you,  I  could  not  even  accept  a \nreward for information given_  I  don't look like a \ncattle  raider,  a  strong-armed  fellow;  that  is  not \nmy line of work.  My  business has been  quite dif \nferent:  my  business  has  been  sleep,  and  my \nmother's  milk,  and  keeping  my  baby  blankets \nround  my  shoulders,  and  hot  baths.  It would  be \nbest if no  one heard about this quarrel;  the gods \nwould  be incredulous at the idea that a new-born \ninfant should  take  a  herd of cattle  which  should \nbe  grazing  in  the  fields  and  bring them  into the \ngrounds  of his  house.  There is  no  sense  in  what \nyou say: I was born yesterday, my feet are tender \nand the ground  is  rough.

Chase  and  William  G.  Perry, Jr. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nOF  THE two  poems  ascribed  to  Homer,  the Iliad  and the \nOdyssey, the Iliad was,  to  its first  audiences and for  gen\u00b7 \nerations  after,  their  favorite  poem.  To  a  more  recent, \nmore romantic, and less classical age the Odyssey, which \nis  easier  to  grasp  on  a  quick  reading,  has  proved  more \nattractive.  But  to  our  own  time,  willing  through  bitter \nexperience to  face  the  facts  of war,  the Iliad.  evoking  as \nit  does  the  pity  and  the  terror,  the  splendor  and  the \nsqualor, the nobility and the baseness, of men and women \ninvolved  in the stress of  conflict,  is  regaining its ancient \nand  perennial appeal. \n\nBut  for  its  understanding,  the  Iliad  needs  a  transla\u00b7 \ntion  which  shall  not  lose  Homer's  rapidity  through  ar\u00b7 \nchaism,  nor  his  dignity  through  a  slick  or  crude  collo\u00b7 \nquialism.  This  translation,  therefore,  uses  the  formal \n\"thou\"  only  in  addresses  to  the  gods,  and  relies  for  its \narchaic  flavor  upon  the  heroic  epithets  and  the  conven\u00b7 \ntional  formulae  of  the oral epic.  The problem in a  prose \ntranslation  is  of  course  to  make  the  reader  aware  that \nHomer  is  poetry;  where  the  translators  have  failed,  the \nsense  of  poetry  may  still  be  supported  by  the  vigor  of \nHomer's  stride.  These  requirements  in  a  translation  are \nmet  by  George  Herbert  Palmer's Odyssey.  but  the  Odys\u00b7 \nsey  is  full  of  feminine  ease  and  grace,  while  the  Iliad \nis  bone  and  muscle;  its  sentences  are  passionate  rather \nthan  romantic,  active  rather  than  adventuresome;  their \ndignity  is  not  in the  leisure  of fiction  but in  the  facing \nof fact. Therefore a translation of the Iliad must be force\u00b7 \nful;  else  it fails  to  do  justice  to  the  vast  action  of  the \nbattle  setting  and  to  the  power  of  the  central  tragedy \nwhich  Homer  builds  around  Achilles'  spurning  of  the \nsupplication of his friends. \n\nThe forceful  impress  upon the reader of  Homer's style \nin tbe Iliad is achieved,  as always  in the best Greek  art, \nby  extreme  simplicity  and  economy  of  means.  It  is  a \nmistake to  confuse  this simplicity with  primitive naivete. \nHomer,  no  more  than  Herodotus,  is  a  childishly  simple \nstory teller.  The very opening scene of  supplication  by  a \nvery  minor  character,  the  priest  Chryses,  is  simplicity \nitself,  but  it  strikes  the  major  ethical  key  of  the  entire \npoem.

The  effect  of  simplicity, \nthen,  is  the  art  that  conceals  art. \n\nThe  subtleties  of  Homer's  art  have  always  fascinated \ncritics,  even  those  absorbed  in  the  unanswered  scholarly \nquestion  whether the Iliad was  the work of a  single poet, \nor  the  collective  work  of  a  long  line  of  bards.  To  the \nmore  sensitive  of  these  critics  \"Homer\"  is  simply  the \ngenius that produced a masterpiece. The full  appreciation \nof these subtleties by  the modern  reader may be impeded \nby  the epic  conventions  Homer  uses;  by the  assumption \nhe makes that his reader is familiar with  the background \nof  the  tale  he  has  to  tell;  by  the  mass  and  bulk  of  the \npoem, which tends  to  obscure  its  dramatic structure. \n\nThe conventions  Homer  uses are imposed  upon  him  in \npart  by  his  meter,  the  dactylic  hexameter,  in  part by  his \nreligious  heritage,  and  in  part  by  the  exigencies  of  oraI \ntransmission.  They include  patronymics,  genealogies, tra\u00b7 \nditional  epithets, exact  repetition  of  messages,  fixed  nar\u00b7 \nrative phrases, full\u00b7dress epic similes, detailed descriptions \nof  sacrifices  to  the  gods,  and  supernatural  intervention \nin  the  action  of  the  poem.  This  last,  though  especially \nirritating to  the modern  sense of  fair  play, has  its artistic \npurpose,  partly as  metaphor,  partly  as  reflecting  the  tra\u00b7 \nditional  idea  that a  hero  shall  not  meet  defeat  even  by a \nbetter  man  except  through  outside  agency,  partly  as  a \nharmonious  part  of  a  deadly  destiny. \n\nThe tale  Homer has  to  tell  begins in the tenth  year  of \nthe  Trojan  War  with  the  insulting  of  Achilles  by  Aga\u00b7 \nmemnon, and ends forty\u00b7seven  days later with the funeral \nof  the  Trojan  hero  Hector.  The  poet,  more  dramatist \nthan  historian,  follows  throughout  a  single  brief  and \ntragic  sequence,  placing  the  immediate  \"now\"  of  his \naction  in  sharp  focus  against  a  vast  backdrop  reaching \nout to the farthest limits of space, time, and number. This \n\"epic  breadth\"  may  lose  the  reader  if he  is  unfamiliar \nwith  the  legendary  setting  of  the  story,  which  Homer \ntakes for granted will  be familiar to  his audience. \n\nAmong  the  many  women  upon  whom  Zeus,  the  ruler \nof the gods,  had once cast  his wandering  eye was  Thetis, \none of the fifty daughters of Nereus, a minor sea divinity. \nBut  Zeus'  passion  was  quickly  extinguished  when  he \n\nCopyright 1981.

She was,  accordingly,  married  off \nto  one Peleus, a respectable hero  from  Thessaly. To  their \nmagnificent wedding all the gods were bid, with the single \nand understandable exception of Eris, goddess of Discord. \nBut Eris came nonetheless, and brought with her a golden \napple  inscribed  \"To  the  Fairest,\"  which  she  cast  upon \nthe  table at  the wedding  banquet.  Immediately each god \ndess  claimed  it  for  herself,  but  all  other  claimants  soon \nretired  before  the  three  great  divinities,  Hera,  wife  of \nZeus  and  queen  of  the  gods,  Athena,  goddess of  wisdom, \nand  Aphrodite,  goddess  of  beauty.  None  of  the  gods  was \nrash  enough  to  judge  betwe~tl them,  so  they  decided  to \nsubmit  their  claims  to  a  handsome,  naive  prince,  Paris, \nson  of  King Priam of Troy,  who  was  tending  sheep  upon \nMount  Ida.  Before  him  the  goddesses  appeared  in  their \nnaked  beauty,  but  each,  not  completely  confident  in her \ncharms, offered Paris a further consideration. Hera prom \nised  him power  and  riches;  Athena  promised  him  glory; \nAphrodite  promised  him  the  most  beautiful  woman  in \nthe world.  Paris  gave  the  apple to  Aphrodite. \n\nUnhappily,  the  acknowledged  queen  of  beauty  among \nwomen  was  Helen, who  happened  to  be  already  married \nto  Menelaus  of  Sparta.  So  furious  had  been  the  original \nrivalry  for  Helen's  hand  that  her  Achaean  suitors  had \ntaken an  oath  to  abide  by  her choice  and  to  defend  the \nrights  of  the  man  whom  she  married.  So  when,  with \nAphrodite's  aid,  Paris came  to  Sparta as  guest  of  Mene\u00b7 \nlaus  and  ran  away  with  Helen  and  all  her  treasures, \nMenelaus  immediately  called  upon  his  former  rivals  to \nfulfill  their  pledge.  These,  with  some  reluctance  on  the \npart  of  a  few,  assembled  at  Aulis  under  the  leadership \nof  Agamemnon,  Menelaus' brother, and set sail for  Troy. \nBesides  Agamemnon  and  Menelaus,  the  army  contained \nsuch  notable  heroes  as  Achilles,  the  son  of  Peleus  and \nThetis;  the  huge  and  valiant  Ajax;  Diomedes,  Tydeus' \nson,  a  warrior  second  only  to  Achilles;  Odysseus,  the \nwiliest  of  men;  and  the  aged  and  garrulous  Nestor. \n\nTroy,  the  object  of  their  attack,  was  immensely  rich \nfrom  the  tolls she  levied  on  the  Hellespont  and was well \nfortified  with  beetling  walls.

From all Asia  Minor and Thrace allies poured in \nto  help  the Trojan cause. \n\nFor nine years the Greeks  strove vainly to capture the \ncity.  They supported and amused  themselves  at times  by \nraids upon near.by cities and islands, bringing back booty \nand  women  to  divide  among  the  various  leaders.  From \none  of  these  raids  in  the  tenth  year  there  fell  to  Aga \nmemnon's  share  Chryseis,  daughter of  Chryses,  priest of \nApollo.  It is  at  this  point  that  the  Iliad  opens,  with  the \nattempt of Chryseis' father  to  ransom  her from  Agamem-\n\nnon.  The  latter's  angry  refusal  causes  Apollo  to  send  a \nplague  upon  the  Greek  army.  Agamemnon  is  forced  to \nyield,  but  in  his  anger  he  takes  away  from  Achilles  his \nprize,  Briseis.  This  rouses  the  wrath  of  Achilles. \n\nThe  wrath  of  Achilles  is  the  unifying  theme  of  the \npoem,  the  key  to  its  dramatic  structure.  Running  in  a \nkind of  counterpoint to  this  theme  are two  other  themes, \nthe  war  against  Troy  and  the  will  of  Zeus.  These  three \nthemes  are  introduced  in  the  first  books  and  continue \ncontrapuntally  until  they  are  welded  together  in  the \nperson  of  Achilles  himself  as  he  returns  in  passion  to \nbattle.  In  this  return  he  works  out  the  destiny  to  which \nhis  wrath  led  him,  settles  the  fate  of  Troy,  and  brings \nto  its  close  the  plan  of  Zeus.  Dramatically,  the  poem  di. \nvides  into  three  great acts  or movements.  The first  move \nment  ends  with  Achilles'  refusal  to  accept  either  a  rea \nsonable  apology  from  Agamemnon  or  the  pleas  of  his \nfriends  (Book  IX);  the  second  ends  in  his  grief  over \nthe death of  his friend  Patroclus  (Book  XVIII) ; and the \nlast  ends  with  his  restitution  of  the  body  of  Hector  and \nits burial  (Book  XXIV). \n\nThe details of  the  plot  are given  in  the headings to  the \nselections  below.  Here  it is important to  note  the  artistic \nfunctions  of  the  three  movements.

Now, prophesying \namong  the  Danaans,  you  proclaim  that  for  this \ncause  the  unerring  one  brings  woe  upon  them, \nnamely,  because  I  refused  to  take  the  splendid \nransom  for  Chryses' maiden  daughter, since it is \nmy great desire to keep her in my home.  I prefer \nher,  indeed,  to  Clytemnestra,  my  wedded  wife, \nsince  she  is  inferior  to  her  neither  in  form  nor \nstature nor in mind nor skill at work. Yet even so \nI  am  willing to  give  her  back,  if that be  better, \nafter  all.  I  had rather the men  be safe than that \nthey  die.  But  do  you  at  once  prepare  for  me  a \nprize,  that  I  alone  among  the  Argives  be  not \nprizeless,  since that is  not fitting.  For you  all see \nwhat a prize of mine goes elsewhere.\" \n\nThen  swift\u00b7 footed,  godlike  Achilles  answered \nhim: \"Most noble son of Atreus, greediest of men, \nhow  shall the  great-hearted Achaeans give  you  a \nprize?  For we know of no great store of common \ngoods;  those  things  which  we  took  from  the \nsack  of cities  have been  divided,  nor  is it fitting \nthat  the  men  should  gather  them  again.  But  do \nyou  now  surrender  her  to  the  god;  then  we \nAchaeans  shall  repay  you  three  and  fout  times \nover,  if  ever  Zeus  grant  that  we  sack  the  well \nwalled city of Troy.\" \n\nMighty  Agamemnon  answered  him  and  said: \n\"Seek not thus in your heart to deceive me, brave \nthough  you  be,  godlike  Achilles,  since  you  shall \nnot  trick  nor  persuade  me.  Is  it  your  wish,  so \nthat you  may  keep  your  prize,  that I  meanwhile \nsit tamely lacking mine,  and do  you  bid me give \nher  back?  Yet,  if  the  great-hearted  Achaeans \nwill  give  a  prize  to suit  my  heart,  one  that  will \nserve  as  well-but  if  they  will  not,  then  I  my \nself  will  go  and  take  your  prize,  or  Ajax',  or \nOdysseus',  and  bear it off.

While  he  was  debating  this  in \nheart and mind and was drawing from  the sheath \nhis  mighty  sword,  Athena  came  from  heaven. \nThe  white-armed  Hera  sent  her,  she  who  loved \nand  cherished  in  her  heart  both  men  alike.  She \nstood  behind  the  son  of  Peleus  and  grasped  his \nyellow  hair, appearing to him alone,  and none of \nthe  others  saw  her.  Achilles  was  amazed  and \nturned  about  and  at  once  knew  Pallas  Athena, \nfor  her eyes  gleamed  dreadfully.  Addressing her, \nhe  spoke  winged  words:  \"Why  hast  thou  come \nhere,  child  of  aegis-bearing  Zeus?  That  thou \nmightest  behold  the  insolence  of  Agamemnon, \nAtreus'  son?  This  I  will  tell  thee,  and  I  think \nit  will come to  pass.  By  his  overbearing pride he \nwill  soon  destroy  himself.\" \n\nThen the bright-eyed goddess Athena addressed \nhim:  \"I came  from  heaven  to  check  your  fury, \nif possibly  you  will  obey.  The  white-armed  god \ndess  Hera  sent  me,  she  who  loves  and  cherishes \nin  her heart both men  alike.  Come,  give  up  your \nwrath,  draw  not  your  sword  in  hand,  but  re \nproach  him  with  words,  even  as  it shall  be here \nafter, for  thus  I  prophesy  and  thus shall it come \nto  pass: some  day  you  shall have thrice as  many \nsplendid gifts  because  of this  piece  of insolence; \nrestrain yourself and obey  us.\" \n\nSwift-footed  Achilles  answered  her  and  said: \n\"I  must  respect  your  command,  0  goddess, \nthough  very  angry  at heart.  For it is better thus. \nThe  gods  give  ear  above  all  to  him  who  obeys \nthem.\" \n\nSo  he  spoke,  and  stayed  his  heavy  hand  upon \nthe  silver  hilt  and  thrust  the  great  sword  back \ninto  its  sheath,  nor  did  he  disobey  the  command \nof Athena. And she went toward Olympus to  join \nthe  other  gods  in  the  house  of  aegis-bearing \nZeus. \n\nBut the son  of Peleus  again  with  harsh  words \naddressed  the  son  of  Atreus  and  still  did  not \nabate  his  wrath:  \"Sot,  dog-eyed,  deer-hearted, \nnever has your spirit dared to arm for  battle with \nthe  host  to  go  forth  to  ambush  with  the  best  of \nthe  Achaeans.

But \nover many  sorrow  hung. \n\nBut when  he  came  to  the  fair  house  of Priam, \nwith  its  polished  colonnade-in  it  there  were \nfifty  chambers  of  polished  stone,  built  close  be \nside  each  other,  wherein  the  sons  of  Priam slept \nbeside their wedded wives;  and over against them \non  the  other  side  within  the  court  were  twelve \nroofed  chambers  of  polished  stone,  built  close \nby one another, for  his daughters, where slept the \nsons-in-law of Priam beside their wedded wives \nthere  his  bountiful  mother  came  to  meet  him, \nbringing with  her  Laodice,  fairest  in  face  among \nher  daughters.  She  put  her  hand  upon  him  and \nspoke and said  to  him: \"My child,  why  have you \nleft the  violent  battle and come hither?

Now, \nHector, you  to  me  are father  and queenly mother \nand  brother  as  well,  and  you  are  my  stalwart \nhusband.  Come  now,  have  pity;  remain  here \nupon the wall,  lest you  make your son  an orphan \nand  a  widow  of  your  wife.  Station  your  army \nhere by  the wild  fig  tree, where the city may  best \nbe  assaulted  and  the  wall  be  scaled.  For  three \ntimes the best  of them  have  come here to  try the \nwall with the two  Ajaxes and glorious Idomeneus \nand  the  sons  of  Atreus  and  Tydeus'  valiant son; \nwhether  someone well  skilled  in  soothsaying  told \nthem  or  now  even  their  own  spirit  urges  and \ndrives them  on.\" \n\nThen  great Hector of the  glancing helmet  said \nto her: \"I, too, take thought of these things,  dear \nwife.  But  I  feel  great  shame  before  the  Trojans \nand  their  long.robed  wives  if like  a  coward  I \nskulk from war. Nor does my own heart permit it; \nfor  I  have  learned  to  be  valiant  always  and  to \nfight  among \nthe  foremost  Trojans,  striving \ngreatly  for  my  father's  glory  and  my  own.

So  they  wept  for  Hector  in  his  house while \nstill  he  lived,  for  they  thought  he  never  would \nreturn  again  from  war,  escaped  from  the  might \nand hands of the Achaeans. \n\nNor  did Paris linger in  his lofty house, but as \nsoon  as  he  had  put  on  his  glorious  armor,  all \nfairly  wrought of bronze, he rushed  out through \nthe  city,  confident  in  his  swift  feet,  like  a  horse \nfrom his stall, well fed at the manger, who breaks \nhis tether  and runs galloping  over  the  plain,  ac \ncustomed  to  bathe in a  fair-flowing  river.  Proud\u00b7 \nhe is;  he holds his head high and the mane flows \nabout his shoulders. His knees quickly bear him, \ntrusting in his beauty, to the haunts and pastures \nof the mares.  So Paris, Priam's son, strode down \nfrom  the  heights  of  Pergamus,  gleaming  in  his \narmor like the shining sun, and laughing; and his \nswift  feet  bore  him  on.  Quickly then  he  met  his \nbrother Hector, just as he was about to turn from \nthe  place  where  he  had  lingered  with  his  wife. \nThe  godlike  Alexander  addressed  him  first: \n\"Brother, surely I have delayed you in your haste \nby tarrying too long and I  have not come quickly \nas you bade.\" \n\nThen  Hector  of the  glancing  helmet  answered \nhim: \"Fool, no man is just who would make light \nof your work in  battle, when you are valiant.

Dear  friend,  surely  your  father  Peleus \nthus  advised  you  on  that  day  when  he  sent  you \nfrom  Phthia  to  Agamemnon.  'My  son,  Athena \nand  Hera will  give  you  strength, if they  so  wish, \nbut  for  yourself  keep  a  great-hearted  spirit  in \nyour  breast,  for  it  is  better  to  be  friendly.

In the  next passage  (479-523)  Phoenix \ncontinues  his  speech,  pleading  with  Achilles  to \nyield.] \n\nI  came  to  fertile  Phthia,  mother  of  flocks,  to \nKing  Peleus.  He  received  me  with kindness  and \nloved me as a father loves his cherished only son \namid rich possessions, and he made me rich and \ngave  me  many  men  to  rule.  I  dwelt  in  Phthia's \nborders,  ruling  the  Dolopians.  To  your  present \ngreatness  I  have  reared  you,  godlike  Achilles, \nloving  you  from  my  heart,  for  with  no  other \nwould  you  go  to  dine  nor  eat  within  the  halls, \nuntil  I  set  you  on  my  knee  and  cut  and  fed  to \nyou  your  meat  and  held  your  wine  cup  to  your \nlips.  Many  a  time  you  wet  the  shirt  upon  my \nchest,  spirting  out  wine in naughty  childishness. \nMuch have  I toiled and suffered over you, think\u00b7 \ning  the  gods  would  never  give  me  child  of  my \nown;  but I made you  my  child, godlike Achilles, \nthat some day you  might ward off unseemly ruin \nfrom me. Now, Achilles, master your great spirit, \nnor should you  have a heart that knows no  pity, \nfor  even  the  gods  themselves  are  placable,  ale \nthough their excellence  and honor and might are \ngreater  still.  With  sacrifice  and  gentle  prayers, \nwith  libations  and  the  smoke  of  offerings,  men \nturn  them  by  their  supplications  when  someone \nhas transgressed and erred. For there are Prayers, \ndaughters of great Zeus, lame and wrinkled, with \nsideward\u00b7glancing  eyes,  who  follow  troubled  be\u00b7 \nhind blind Folly.  Blind Folly is mighty and swift \nof  foot,  wherefore she runs far  ahead  of  all  and \nis first  to reach all parts of the earth and do men \nharm,  and  the  Prayers  heal  the  hurt  thereafter. \nWhoever  reverences  the  daughters  of  Zeus  as \nthey  draw near, him they help greatly and to  his \nprayers they listen. But whoever repels them and \nharshly says  them  nay,  they  go  to  Zeus,  the  son \nof  Cronus,  and  pray  that  Ruin  may  follow  him \nso that he may atone in suffering. Come, Achilles, \ndo  you  too  grant  that  honor  may  follow  Zeus' \ndaughters,  honor  which  bends  the  will  of  other \nnoble  creatures  too.  For  if  the  son  of  Atreus \nwere not bringing gifts and telling of more here\u00b7 \nafter,  but  were  persisting  in  furious  anger,  I \nwould  not bid you put aside your wrath and give \nprotection  to  the  Argives,  however  they  might \nneed  it.  But  now  he  gives  you  much  and  has \npromised more hereafter and has chosen the best \nthroughout  the  Achaean  army  and  sent them to \nentreat  you,  even  those  who  are  dearest  to  you \n\nTHE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER \n\n33 \n\nyourself among the  Argives.

It  is  not  fated  the \nbrave Trojans' city should now be  overthrown by \nyour spear, nor even by Achilles, who is better far \nthan  you.\" \n\nSo he spoke, and Patroclus fell far back, avoid\u00b7 \n\ning the wrath of the unerring Apollo. \n\nBut  Hector  checked  his  single.hoofed  horses \nin  the  Scaean  gates;  for  he  debated  whether  he \nshould  drive  them  back  and  fight  again  in  the \ntumult  or  should  call  to  the  people  to  gather \nwithin  the  wall.  As  he  pondered  this,  Phoebus \nApollo  stood  beside  him,  in  the  likeness  of  a \nstrong  and  mighty  man,  Asius,  who  was  a  rna\u00b7 \nternal uncle  of horse\u00b7taming Hector,  own  brother \nof  Hecuba,  and  son  of  Dymas,  who  dwelt  in \nPhrygia  by  Sangarius'  streams.  In  this  man's \nlikeness  Zeus's  son  Apollo  addressed  him:  \"Hec\u00b7 \ntor,  why  do  you  cease  from  battle?  You  ought \nnot.  Would  I  were  as  much  your  better  as  I  am \nyour  inferior.  Surely  then  you  would  withdraw \nfrom battle at your cost. Come, drive your strong\u00b7 \nhoofed  horses  after  Patroclus,  in  the  hope  that \nyou  may  take  him,  and  Apollo  may  give  you \nglory.\" \n\nSo  speaking,  the  god  went  back  among  the \nstrife  of  heroes,  and  glorious  Hector  ordered \nprudent Cebriones to  whip the horses into  battle. \nBut  Apollo  went  and  entered  the  fray  and  sent  a \ndisastrous tumult  on  the  Argives  and  gave  glory \nto  the  Trojans  and  to  Hector.  Hector  let  the \nother  Danaans  be  and  did  not  slay  ther.l,  but \ndrove  his  strong\u00b7hoofed  horses  after  Patroclus. \nAnd Patroclus, on the other side, leaped from his \nchariot  to  the  ground,  holding  his  spear  in  his \nleft  hand;  in  the  other  he  grasped  a  shining, \njagged stone, which his hand covered.  He  braced \nhimself  and  threw  it;  neither  did  he  withdraw \nmuch  from  his  foe,  nor  did  he  hurl  the  missile \nin  vain,  but  hit  Hector's  charioteer  Cebriones, \nthe bastard son of far\u00b7 famed Priam, as he held the \nreins  of  the  horses.  He  hit  him  in  the  forehead \nwith the sharp stone.  The  stone  crushed  both his \nbrows,  nor  did  the  bone  hold  firm.

The  tendons  of  both  feet  he  pierced \nbehind from heel to ankle and threaded them with \nox-hide thongs  and  tied  them  to  his  chariot  and \nallowed  the  head  to  drag.  He  mounted  the \nchariot, held aloft the glorious armor, and lashed \nthe  horses  to  a  gallop,  and  not  unwillingly  the \npair  flew  off.  A  cloud  of  dust  rose  from  the \ndragging Hector; his dark hair spread about, and \nall  in  the  dust lay  his  head  that  was  so  fair  be \nfore;  but  now  Zeus  gave  him  to  his  enemies  to \nmutilate  in his  own  native  land. \n\nSo  his  head  was  all  befouled  with  dust,  and \nhis  mother  tore  her  hair  and  cast  her  shining \nveil  far  from  her  and  gave  a  great  shriek  when \nshe  saw  her  son.  Then  his  dear  father  gave  a \npiteous  groan  and  the  people  around  him  were \nfilled  with cries and  lamentations throughout the \ncity. Most like this it was:  as though all towering \nIlium burned from top to bottom.  For the people \ncould scarcely hold the  old man,  who  was  beside \nhimself with grief and  wished  to  go  out from the \nDardanian  gates.  He  rolled  in  the  dust  and \nbegged  them  all,  calling  each  man  by  name: \n\"Stop, my  friends,  and  despite  your care for  me \nlet me pass out alone from  the city and  go  to the \nships of the Achaeans.

Now  Hector's wife had \nnot  yet  heard  the  news,  for  no  true  messenger \nhad  gone  to  tell  her  that  her  husband  remained \noutside  the  gates.  She  was  weaving  at  the  loom \nin the inmost corner of her lofty house, a  double \nweb  of purple,  and  was  working  into  its  pattern \nmany-colored  flowers.

In  his  want \nthe lad  goes  up  to  his  father's  comrades,  pulling \none  by  the  cloak  and  another  by  the  tunic,  and \nwhen  they  have  pity  on  him,  one  holds  up  his \ncup a moment to  his mouth and wets his lips but \ndoes  not wet his palate,  and some child from the \nfeast,  with  both  his  parents  living,  abuses  him, \nstriking him  with  his hands  and  upbraiding him \nwith  words:  'Get  out,  there;  your  father  is  not \nfeasting with  us.'

He  found  him  within, \nand  his  companions  sat  apart;  two  only,  the \nheroic  Automedon  and  Alcimus,  scion  of  Ares, \nwaited  busily upon  him.  Achilles had just ceased \nfrom  eating  and  drinking,  and  the  table  still \nstood  beside  him.  Great  Priam  came  in  un \nnoticed,  and,  standing  close  by,  seized  in  his \nhands Achilles' knees and kissed the hands, dread \nful  and  murderous,  that  had  slain  many  of  his \nsons.

Brower \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nTHE  BEST  cue to  give  a  reader  who  wants  to  appreciate \nthe  special  quality  of  the  Odyssey  is  the  obvious  one: \nthe  Odyssey  comes  after  the  lliod.  It is  the story of  \"a \nman  who  wandered  far and wide  after he had  destroyed \nthe  sacred  city  of  Troy.\"  In  the  lliod  we  are  actively \nengaged  in a  cruel  and  destructive war;  our eye  is fixed \non  heroic action  and its consequences.  To be fully aware \nof death  and  destiny and yet to  go  forward  and  fight  for \none's  people-that  is  the  way  of  the  hero  in  the  lliml. \nThe constant motif of the poem  is most clearly expressed \nin  Sarpedon's  cry to  Glaucus:  \"Since  now  ten  thoussnd \nforms  of  death stand around us, which no man  can either \nflee  from  or escape, let us go forward, whether we are to \ngive glory to someone else, or whether someone is to  give \nit to  us!\" \n\nThe Odyssey tells what happens to  one of the greatest \nheroes  of  the  Iliod  after  the  war  is  over.  But  though \nthere are in  the Odyssey no battles quite like those fougllt \non  the plains of  Troy, there are many moments when  we \nsee Odysseus as a leader who is fully aware of the danger \nhe is facing  and who calls his men  to  join him  in coura \ngeous  action.  We  hear  an  echo  of  Sarpedon's  cry  in \nOdysseus'  speech  to  his  men  as  they  approach  Scylla \nand  Charybdis  and  in  his  words  urging  them  to  help \nhim  blind the  Cyclops. \n\nBut  Odysseus  is not  a  Sarpedon  or an  Achilles;  he is \n\nnot  like Shakespeare's  Coriolanus  a  man  who \n\nHis  deeds  with  doing  them,  and  is content \nTo  spend  the time  to  end iL \n\nrewards \n\nThere is nothing paradoxical about Odysseus' heroic  ges \ntUte!l;  he  is  out  to  bring  himself  and  his  men  back  to \nIthaca. The Odyssey is not a drama of fated violence but \nthe story of a  man who  wants  to  get home,  who  longs  to \nsee his wife and son and \"the smoke rising from his own \nland.\" It is a Nostos,  a poem of \"return,\" and  this under \nlying  theme  is  never  wholly  forgotten.  (A  much  later \npoem,  the Nostoi,  tells how a  number of the other heroes \nreturned  home  after  the  fall  of  Troy.)

The  Phacacians  now  take  Odysseus \nback  by  ship  to  Ithaca,  where  after  meeting  his  swine\u00b7 \nherd,  Eumaeus, he  joins Telemachus  and  makes  a  plan to \nkill  the suitors  (Books  XII-XV!).  Odysseus,  disguised  as \na  beggar,  goes  to  his  house  and  is  received  very  rudely \nby  the suitors  and  their friends;  but  Penelope  entertains \nhim  well  and  invites  him  to  spend  the  night  (Books \nXVII-XX!.  On  the  next  day  Penelope  asks  the  suitors \nto  enter  a  strange  contest:  the  man  who  can  string \nOdysseus'  great  bow  and  shoot  it  properly  will  have  the \nprivilege  of  marrying  her.  All  of  the  rivals  try  and  are \nunsuccessful,  but  \"the beggar\"  Odysseus  easily  performs \nthe  feat  (Book  XXI).  Plans for  the  final  fight  now  being \ncomplete,  Odysseus reveals who  he  is,  and  under Athena's \ndirection  and  with  the  help  of  Telemachus,  he  kills  the \nentire  company  of  suitors  (Book  XXII).  He  is  at  last \nrecognized  by  Penelope,  and  on  the  following  day  he  is \nwelcomed  home  by  his  father,  Laertes.  A  battle  is  about \nto  break  out  between  the  relatives  of  the  suitors  and \nOdysseus  and  his  supporters,  when  Athena  arrives  and \nputs  an  end  to  the  quarrel  (Books  XXIII-XXIV).  The \nOdyssey  comes  to  a  close  in  a  series  of  happy  reunions \nand  reconciliations. \n\nA  reader  of  the Iliad  who  hears  only  this  brief outline \nof the later poem  will  see  that  the  Odyssey  brought some\u00b7 \nthing  new  into  European  literature.  New,  but  extremely \nfamiliar  to  readers of  the  novel.  The story  of  the Odyssey \nis full  of  \"plot,\" in  more  than  one  sense  of  the  term.  For \nexample, apparently separate  narrative  lines  are followed \nand  then  connected  at a crucial  moment:  Telemachus ar\u00b7 \nrives  just  in  time  to  help  his  father  regain  his  rights. \nThere  is  also  a  good  deal  of  intrigue,  of  planning  in \nheaven  and  on  earth  to  bring  Odysseus home  and  to  pre\u00b7 \npare  a  trap  for  his  enemies.  Here  is  a  complexity  quite \ndifferent  from  that  of  the  Iliad,  where  the main  narrative \nline  is  quite  simple,  though  occasionally  interrupted  by \nepisodes of  Olympian  comedy or heroic daring. The sense \nof  richness  in  the  Iliad  arises  in  part  from  the  mere \naccumulation  of  similar  episodes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad9b81c8-dc3c-4783-8ac3-d51a7aacc26e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad9b81c8-dc3c-4783-8ac3-d51a7aacc26e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0da29a67-52d7-4d6b-ab1e-590964d20398", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "2dfde976522868cada957385def3d805c6f08b36fe656f1992c3a7268786dbef"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d233131-8458-4f49-b0c9-0b5babbce0f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "8d0dfd693e2288007710eeb7d4bec6f68db51570e2cbc77752528583fd752739"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd9f10bb-62cb-4188-be79-4673e1115313", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "f24e76249642b8000f1d6203e0fbf918728e36f8c59f683e53ab2b0aaf5cedeb"}}, "hash": "3aa3268bd414fb9005e5fbe24227b186674eee5e6700e9575c8930b8ab834315", "text": "But  it  is  created  more \nespecially  through  the  leisurely  and  complete  unfolding \nof  the  tragic  irony  of  Achilles'  action  and  through  the \nevolution  of  his  wrath  from  quarrelsomeness  to  violent \nhatred  and  a  painful  recognition  of  error  and  loss.  We \nmust use quite different terms to  describe the organization \nof  the  Odyssey:  we  do  not  speak  of  accumulation  (lr  the \nunfolding of tragic irony, but of the connection of separate \nnarratives, of intrigues and adventures, of happy reunions \nbetween  father and son  or husband and wife. \n\nBut  external  descriptions  of  this  sort  give  a  pale  sense \nof  the  difference  between  the  two  epics.  We  can  appre\u00b7 \nciate  the  novelty  of  the  Odyssey  only  by  getting  into  it, \nby  turning  to  one or  two  points where  the  heroic  quality \nof the Iliad seems almost forgotten.  Consider, for example, \nthe  opening  of  the  scene  in  which  Odysseus  meets  the \nswineherd  Eumaeus.  A reader of  the  Greek  will  find  that \nthe  heroic  tone  is  not  wholly  lost:  like  Odysseus  and \nAchilles, the swineherd is called dios,  noble  (or glorious), \n\nand  orchamos andron,  a leader  of  men.  But in total  effect \nand  in  detail  the  scene  is  quite  unheroic;  it is  a  Theocri\u00b7 \ntean  idyll  written  before  its  time.  For  however  important \nthe  meeting  is  dramatically,  as  a  step  in  Odysseus'  plan \nto  murder  the  suitors,  the  main  effect  of  the  scene  is  to \npresent  a  particular place  and  a  distinct  person.  We  see \nEumaeus'  yard  \"lined with  quarried  stone  and  topped off \nwith  a  layer  of  thorny  brushwood\"  and  \"his  four  dogs, \nfierce  as  wild  beasts,\" and the swineherd  himself, \"sitting \nin  the  doorway\"  of  his  cabin,  \"cutting  some  sandals  out \nof  a  stout  piece  of  cowhide and  fitting  them  to  his  feet.\" \nWhen  Eumaeus  saw  the  dogs  attacking  his  master,  \"let\u00b7 \nting  the  leather  fall  from  his  hand,  he  dashed  through \nthe gateway, and yelling at the dogs  and  Ringing  a shower \nof stones after them,  he sent them  all  running  in  different \ndirections.\"  Through  this  emphasis  On  particular objects \nand gestures, we get a wonderful sense of a unique person; \nfor  the  moment,  at  least,  we  are  interested  in  character \nfor its own sake. Readers of the whole poem will find many \nsimilar moments  in  the Odyssey;  the kind of  interedt they \narouse  is  as  far  removed  as  possible  from  what  we  feel \nin  reading  of  Sarpedon's  or  Hector's  or  Achilles'  deeds \nand  death.  The  accent  of  those  narratives  is  splendidly \nimpersonal  and  larger  than  life:  it  is  heroic  rather  than \nindividual. \n\nThe  scene  between  Odysseus  and  Eumaeus  is  striking \nin  still  another  way:  Eumaeus,  the  principal  actor,  is \ndistinctly  a  servant;  his  occupation,  his manner,  the  ob.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd9f10bb-62cb-4188-be79-4673e1115313": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd9f10bb-62cb-4188-be79-4673e1115313", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0da29a67-52d7-4d6b-ab1e-590964d20398", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "2dfde976522868cada957385def3d805c6f08b36fe656f1992c3a7268786dbef"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad9b81c8-dc3c-4783-8ac3-d51a7aacc26e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 54, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "3aa3268bd414fb9005e5fbe24227b186674eee5e6700e9575c8930b8ab834315"}}, "hash": "f24e76249642b8000f1d6203e0fbf918728e36f8c59f683e53ab2b0aaf5cedeb", "text": "jects  he  uses  belong  to  a  social  milieu  that  appears  in \nthe  Iliad  only  in  the  similes,  that  is,  in  the  background, \nnever  in  the  foreground,  of  the  narrative.  The  Odyssey \ngives  a  surprising importance to  the swineherd, to  Melan. \nthius  the  goatherd,  to  the  village  beggar  hus,  and  to \nEurycleia,  Odysseus'  old  nurse.  We  are  again  reminded \nof the novel. Though the Homer of the Odyssey was hardly \na  Balzacian  realist,  he  was  considerahly  interested  in \npicturing humble persons  and  places  and things. If much \nof  the  Iliad  is  heroic  tragedy,  the  Odyssey  often  comes \nnearer  to  domestic  comedy.  In  the  swineherd  scene  the \nimpression  of comedy  is  underlined  by  the  humor of  this \npicture  of  a  bustling,  scolding,  yet  faithful  servant.  Eu. \nmaeus  is like a  New  England farmer  who  puts a  traveller \nup  for  the  night  while  saying  that  he  is  overworked  and \nhaH\u00b7starved  and  really  not  \"up  to  much  any  more.\" \nOdysseus  too  is  a  figure  of  comedy:  he  stands  in  the \nbackground,  the  cunning  master  in  disguise  who  smiles \nwith delight as he sees the proof of loyalty in his servant's \ngenerous  entertainment. \n\nBut the  Odyssey has  further surprises for readers  fresh \nfrom  the  Iliad.

But half way through, something \nhas  happened.  We  have  left  any  possible  garden  for  a \nland  out  of  Nature.  The  garden  is  magical,  and  no  at \ntempt  is  made  to  explain  its  wonders.  If  we  think  of \nromantic  literature  as  reflecting  the  world  of  dream  as \nopposed  to  normal waking experience, we  have  moved  in \nAlcinous'  garden  from  realism  to  romance.  To  borrow \nHenry  James's  definition  of  romance,  we  have  entered \nthe  realm  of  \"uncontrolled  experience-uncontrolled  by \nour general sense of 'the way things happen.' \" The mirac \nulous interventions of the gods in the Iliad are not roman \ntic  in  the  same  sense,  because  for  one  thing  the  events \nthat take place in the human drama are often the kind of \nthing  that  does  \"happen.\"  The interventions of the  gods \noffer a rationalization or symbolic enlargement of  actions \nthat are thoroughly explicable in  human terms.  But often \nin  the  Odyssey,  as  in  the  garden  of  Alcinous,  the  very \nhuman hero  encounters creatures and events that are not \nnormally  explicable  and  not  explained  within  the  poem. \nA narrative poem composed only of the fabulous episodes \nfrom  the Odyssey would  read like a Greek Faerie Queene \nand would  fit  exactly  a  contemporary  criticism  of  Spen \nser's  dreamy  epic:  \"Hobgoblin run  away  with a  garland \nfrom  Apollo.\" \n\nHomer maintains a  fine  balance between heroic  poetry \nand  romance  by  setting  his  wondrous  tales  in  a  story \nwhose  dominant  motif  is  the  most  normal  imaginable: \nthe  desire  to  get  back  home.  Odysseus  is  not  a  knight \nerrant, not  at all  like  Tennyson's  Ulysses,  who  seeks \"a \nnewer  world\": \n\nfor my purpose holds \n\nTo sail beyond the sunset, and the baths \nOf  all  the western stars, until  I  die. \n\nIt  is  worth  noting  that  Homer  does  not  tell  the  most \nfantastic  tales  in  his  own  person.  He lets  Odysseus  tell \nthem,  and  Odysseus  was  a  man  who  could  make  up  a \ngood  yarn  when  one  was  needed.  The  traditional  epic \nlanguage  does  not  let  us  forget  that  these  are  tales told \nby  a  hero;  and the  constant stress on  Odysseus' cool  in \ntelligence  in  all  situations imparts a  feeling  of sanity  to \nthe  most  nightmarish adventures.

Without accepting \nLonginus'  evaluation,  we  may  agree  that  his  chronology \n\"is  correct,\"  that  the  Odyssey  is  the  later  of  the  two \nHomeric poems.

But \nwe  may  say  that  the  \"actual\"  world  rellected  in  the \nOdyssey is more  often that of a  much  later period,  when \nthe  Phoenicians  were  the  great  traders  in  the  Mediter \nranean, when  the Greeks were  newcomers to the seaways. \nHence  in a  Greek  poem,  the atmosphere  of  \"antres  vast \nand  desarts  idle.\" \n\nIn  the  period  following  the  composition  of  the  two \nHomeric  epics,  a  number of  poems  were  composed,  such \nas  the  Nostoi  mentioned  above,  in  which  the  whole  tale \nof  Troy  was  told,  from  the  throwing  of  the  apple  of \nDiscord  to  the  death  of Odysseus.  But  the  greatest of all \nthe continuations of Homer  is Vergil's  Aeneid. It is  easy \nenough  to  see  where  Vergil  followed  the  main  narrative \npattern of the earlier poems and where he borrowed whole \nepisodes,  but  it is  his  omissions  that  are  revealing.  The \nfirst  half  of the Aeneid is  an  Odyssey  minus  most  of  the \nfabulous  tales  and with  all  the comedy of  character  and \nintrigue  removed.  What  survives  from  the  Odyssey  is  a \nheroic journey from  Troy and a drama of divine thrusting \non.  Aeneas  is  not  returning  home;  he  is  an  exile  driven \nby  fate  who  has  the  high  destiny  of  founding  mighty \nRome. \n\nThe  difference  between  VergiIian  and  Homeric  epic  is \nwell symbolized by the contrast between Iopas, the learned \n\"Lucretian\"  singer at  Dido's  court,  and  Demodocus,  the \nself-taught, divinely inspired bard who sings for Alci~ous \nand his fellow-princes.  Vergil  ia  a poet of immense learn \ning,  a  poet  of  ideas  and  rellective  sentiments,  a  creator \n01  ever  varied  expressions.  He  is  as  far  removed  as  pos \nsible from  the singer who  practises an art of popular oral \ncomposition, who  retells a familiar story in language that \nhas  been  largely  made  for  him  by  earlier  singers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a35b375-7b94-4c45-8208-1d6bc2b2ac0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a35b375-7b94-4c45-8208-1d6bc2b2ac0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 55, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "48d5874a-db6d-4218-b39e-be7f2809b99e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 55, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "a94fd272fadffaa546fffcdee322fe70e696b874caa2730d72f397eb0aca8495"}, "2": {"node_id": "e046296d-752e-4d61-82c5-c0e87797bb57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 55, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "db6e6060b0587c8e7429c73b40696b1c97f685ead2a2e3bd6caa5cb2413cdb63"}}, "hash": "c4a5526b543676c95ba1ffaec1754e73e158dc60428df6db265e6988d6e1a94e", "text": "The \nHomeric  bard  is  intent  on  his  story,  on  the  actions  and \nsufferings  of  his  heroes.

But \nno  more  shouting,  please, because  it's a  pleasant \nthing to hear such a bard as  Phemius, who  has  a \nvoice  like  one  of the  gods. \n\n\"When morning comes,  we shall all  go  and sit \nin  formal  assembly,  where  I  intend  to  tell  you \nquite frankly to leave my  father's house.  Go  hold \nyour  feasts  elsewhere,  travel  from  one  house  to \nanother,  and  eat up your  own  wealth!

But I  call the  ever-living gods to hear \nmy  words,  in hope that Zeus will give us a day of \nvengeance. Then you will die here in this house- \nand  no  one  will  pay  the  price  for  that,  either!\" \nThe  suitors,  biting  their  lips  in  fury,  were  as \ntounded at the  bold way  Telemachus  now  talked \n[325-382] \nto them. \n\n[In  Books  II  and  III,  omitted  here,  Telem \nachus  calls  a  council  and  asks  the  suitors  to \nleave.

There was not a sign any\u00b7 \nwhere of  a harbor for  ships,  nor any roadsteads, \nnothing  but  jutting  shores  with  reefs  and  cliffs. \nThen  Odysseus'  legs  grew  weak,  and  his  heart \nfailed  him.  Feeling  utterly  miserable,  he  said  to \nhimself, \"Oh, what is going to happen to me now? \nZeus  has  let  me  see  land-which  I  hardly  had \nhoped  for-and  I  have  reached  the  end  of  my \ntrip  across  these  deep  and  terrible  waters;  but \nI  can  see  no  way  of  getting  out  of the  grey  sea. \nOn  the shore facing me  there are only sharp cliffs \nwith waves roaring and dashing around them and \nwith  smooth rock running straight up. The sea is \ndeep  close  into  shore,  and  there  isn't  a  place \nwhere a man could set both feet  and not get hurt. \nIf I  do  step  out,  a  big  wave  will  probably  pick \nme up and throw me  against the  cliff,  and so my \nefforts to make the shore will be wasted. If I swim \nfurther  along,  on  the  chance  of  finding  shores \nand  coves  where  the  waves  come  in  sideways \ninstead  of  head  on,  I'm  afraid  that  a  gust  of \nwind  will pick me  up  again  and  carry me  groan\u00b7 \ning back over the sea. Or else some god may send \na huge sea monster to attack me,  one of the many \ncreatures  that  glorious  Amphitrite  breeds.  For I \nknow  that  Odysseus  is  an  odious  name  to  the \ngreat earthshaker.\" \n\nWhile  he  was  turning  these  thoughts  over  in \nhis mind,  a  great wave  was  carrying him toward \nthe  jagged  shoreline.  Then  his  skin  would  have \nbeen  flayed  from  him  and  his  bones crushed,  if \ngleaming-eyed Athena had not put a good idea in \nhis head. As he was  rushing along towards shore, \nhe took hold of a rock with both hands and clung \nto  it  groaning,  until  the  wave  had  passed  over \nhim.  In  this  way  he  escaped  from  being  dashed \nagainst  the cliff,  but when  the wave  flowed  back \nwith a rush, it struck him and carried him far out \nto  sea.  As  when  an  octopus  is  pulled  from  its \nhole  and  the  pebbles  cling  to  the  suckers  at  the \nend  of  its  tentacles,  so  Odysseus'  skin  stuck  to \nthe rocks  and was  stripped from  his  stout hands. \nAt  that  same  moment  the  wave  completely  cov \nered  him.

Coming  out \nfrom  under  the wave  which  was  now  roaring  in \nto shore, he swam along with  an eye  on the land, \ntrying  to  find  shores  and  coves  where  the  waves \ncame  in  sideways.

Then  Odysseus'  legs  gave  way  and  his \nstrong  hands  failed  him,  for  he  was  heartsick \nand  tired  from  the  sea.  His  skin  swelled  up  all \nover his body, and salt  water gushed  in  a  stream \nfrom  his  mouth  and  nostrils.

As \nOdysseus  lay  there  close  covered  with  leaves, \nAthena  poured  sleep  over  his  eyes  and  gently \nclosed  his  lids,  bringing  him  quick  release  from \n[313-493] \npain  and  weariness. \n\nBook  VI \n\nODYSSEUS'  WELCOME  IN  THE  LAND  OF  THE \n\nPHAEACIANS \n\nWhile  noble  Odysseus,  worn  out  with  lack  of \nsleep  and  fatigue,  was  sleeping  there,  Athena \nwent  to  the  country  and  city  of  the  Phaeacians. \nYears  ago  this  people  lived  in  Hyperia,  a  land \nof broad open  plains,  where they  were  neighbors \nof  the  Cyclopes,  a  most  arrogant  race  of  men. \nBut  the  Cyclopes,  being  more  powerful  than  the \nPhaeacians,  kept  attacking  them  and  plundering \ntheir land.  So  their  godlike  ruler  Nausithous  led \nthem  out  of  Hyperia  and  settled  them  far  from \nother  men  in  Scheria,  where  he  made  a  walled \ntown,  built  houses  and  temples,  and  divided  the \nfarm  lands.  But long before the coming of Odys \nseus  Nausithous  had  died  and  gone  to  Hades' \nhouse,  and Alcinous,  a  man  who  had  been  given \ngood  judgment  by  the  gods,  had  become  ruler \nof  the  country. \n\nIt was  to  his house that gleaming-eyed  Athena \nhad  gone,  to  provide  a  way  for  brave  Odysseus \nto  return  home.  She  went  along  to  a  room  built \nwith  great  art,  where  a  young  girl  was  sleeping \nwho  had  the  face  and  figure  of  a  goddess.  Her \nname  was  Nausicaa,  and  she  was  the  daughter \nof  brave  Alcinous.  Two  waiting  women  whose \nbeauty  was  a  gift  of  the  graces  were  watching \nover her,  one at either side of the doorposts. The \nshining doors between them were closed. \n\nLike  a  gust  of  wind  Athena  slipped  through \nto  where  the girl was  sleeping and stood bending \nover  her.  As  the  goddess  spoke  to  Nausicaa,  she \ntook  the  form  of  the  daughter  of  the  famous \nmariner Dymas.  She was  just Nausicaa's age and \na dear friend  of hers. \"Nausicaa,\" she said, \"how \n\ndid  your  mother  ever  come  to  have  such  a  lazy \ndaughter!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f449083-26e1-42e1-b3d2-efd6b548190a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f449083-26e1-42e1-b3d2-efd6b548190a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 62, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4df3e576-9de4-4db4-b40e-3ff5000968b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 62, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "ab0b045d0d428126d52244f707f0889b784e42568a734b24100ee4c582740140"}, "2": {"node_id": "99f326d5-1205-4e44-89f3-d9a778ff23de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 62, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "8fd7767b1b7802b846db75163c4be576fba21049b627f312f9526ddf12f88585"}}, "hash": "28e837c6bb9dd0a6b343f5340f7a585b2557444df6eb71e316e7dfe3ecdedb70", "text": "Your  beautiful  clothes  lie  all  soiled; \nand  yet  the time  for  your marriage  is very  near, \nwhen  you  must  be  beautifully  dressed  and  pro \nvide  clean  clothes  for  your  wedding  attendants. \nThat's how  you  can  get a  good name among peo \nple  and  please  your  father  and  mother.

Then  the  king's  daughter  tossed  the \nball to one of her women,  but missed  her, and as \nshe  threw  it  into  the  deep  eddy  at  the  river's \nmouth,  they  all  cried  out. \n\nAt  the  sound  of  their  voices  noble  Odysseus \nawoke,  and  sitting  up  said  wonderingly  to  him \nself:  \"And whose land have I  come to  now?  Are \nthe  men  here wild  and  savage  and with  no  sense \nof  right,  or  do  they  fear  the  gods  and  receive \nstrangers  kindly?  Just  now  I  heard  around  me \nthe  shrill  cry  of  mountain  nymphs  who  live  on \nsteeply sloping peaks and in the sources of streams \nand  in  grassy  meadows.  Or  are  those  human \nvoices  I  hear  close  by?  Come,  I'll  go  see  what \nthey  are.\" \n\nWith  those  words  noble  Odysseus  came  from \nunder  the  thicket.  As  he  stepped  out,  he  broke \na  leafy  branch  from  the  dense  growth  and  held \nit  in  front  of  him  to  cover  his  male  parts  from \nbeing  seen.  Odysseus  went  along  like  a  bold \nmountain  lion  when  he  goes  with  blazing  eyes \nthrough wind and rain and makes his way among \ncattle  or sheep  on  the  range,  or when  he  chases \ndeer  through  the  wilds,  or when  he  is  driven  by \nhis  belly  to  come  right  into  the  fold  and  attack \nthe  flocks.  In the  same  way  Odysseus  in  his  des\u00b7 \nperate need of help  started to  go  in  among those \nyoung girls.  Naked  as  he  was  and all  caked  over \nwith  brine,  he  was  a  fearful  sight  for  them  to \nsee,  and  they  scattered  in  panic,  running  out  on \nthe jutting shores. Only Alcinous' daughter stayed \nbehind;  for  Athena  had  filled  her  with  courage \nand taken  all feeling  of fear  from  her  body. The \nbright.eyed  girl  stood  still  and  faced  Odysseus, \nwhile  he  wondered  whether  he  should  clasp  her \nknees  as  suppliants  do  and  ask  for  help,  or \nwhether he  should stand off and in  a gentle voice \nask  her  to  give  him  clothes  and  show  him  the \nway  to  the  city.  It seemed  wiser,  he  thought,  for \nhim  to  keep  his  distance  and  speak  to  her  quite \ngently,  for  he  was  afraid  that  if he  touched  the \ngirl,  she  would  be  angry with  him. \n\n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/2/2023 4:08 PM via UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f22b1699-04af-424c-88ae-a982a36f67d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f22b1699-04af-424c-88ae-a982a36f67d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 63, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b94a4574-96c8-496e-9905-b8e9ded097a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 63, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "9bec575fa66a9c55ea612e4476cb0848638060a4f4d413a619ada74b9084ff9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8942177-2bb3-4434-8596-f12c2a8b42c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 63, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "e3accc12d560a93795f77122b45dd0dba3cac98854438f6388bfccc61b292869"}}, "hash": "a3731207a3542fbba06c1bde262b479c9a2c3f5edd9b52887fed3716bbdb0ada", "text": "All use subject to https://www.ebsco.com/terms-of-use", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30c4069c-27ae-45ea-8339-7ee5a9a3cb5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "30c4069c-27ae-45ea-8339-7ee5a9a3cb5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 64, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c06c3373-c75a-4c3b-9e74-e929e215fcca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 64, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "a9af8793a491dfda03452035515829be4695f642ca10c5c87b6ad6ae2293fbd0"}, "3": {"node_id": "630213f1-8d1f-4a87-902f-b7736a67d9ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 64, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "4e321ae4adf71251e4a1c7b4f58a46983539c6cec6c420843b2e46db95216481"}}, "hash": "36a8617928d675bbc2d0cf4037c7ae9dff5bcc6733a45d0c80ea10bb2442ec62", "text": "60 \n\nCLASSICS  IN  TRANSLATION \n\nHe  then  began  a  clever  and  soothing  speech: \n\"I  beg  you  to  help  me,  noble  lady-but tell  me, \nare  you  a  goddess  or  a  mortal?

Their  hearts \nmust  glow  with  pleasure  when  they see  so  fair  a \nflower  entering  the  dance.  But  happiest  of  all \nmen  will  be  the  one  who  wins  you  with his gifts \nand  brings  you  home  for  his  bride.  For  I  have \nnever seen  such  a person, either man  or woman; \nwhen  I  look  at  you,  I  am  filled  with  awe.

He  never  went \nto  see others, but lived his lawless life alone; yes, \nhe  was  a marvellous and monstrous creature, not \nat all like a human being, but like a wooded peak \nthat you see rising above all the others in a range \nof  mountains. \n\n\"Then  I  chose  twelve  of  my  best  men  to  go \nalong  with  me  and  ordered  the  rest  of  my  good \ncomrades  to  stay  near  the  ship  and  guard  it.  I \ntook along with  us a goatskin  of dark sweet wine \nwhich  had  been  given  me  by  Maron,  the son  of \nEuanthes,  priest  of  Apollo,  because  once  out  of \nreverence  for  his  calling  we  had  protected  him \nand his wife and child.  (We had found him living \nin  a  grove  sacred  to  Phoebus  Apollo,  the  god \nwho  watches  over  Ismarus.)  Now  Maron  had \np;h-en  me  some  splendid  presents:  seven  talents \nof finely made gold, a wine bowl entirely of silver, \nand  wine  which  he  drew  off  in  jars,  twelve  of \nthem altogether.  It was sweet and not mixed with \nwater, a heavenly  drink!  None of the servants or \nattendants  in  the household  knew  about  it,  only \nMaron  himself  and  his  wife  and  one  house \nkeeper.  When  he  drank  that  ruddy  wine,  he \npoured one full  cup of wine into twenty of water, \nand  yet  the  fragrance  that  rose  from  the  bowl \nwas  exquisite.  Once  poured,  it  was  not  a  drink \nyou  would care to refuse! \n\n\"So  I  filled  a  great  wineskin  with  it  and  car\u00b7 \nried  it  along  and  took  other  provisions  in  a \nleather  sack.  For  brave  as  I  was,  the  thought \nat  once  struck  me  that  we  were  going  to  meet  a \nman  filled  with  immense  strength,  a  savage  who \nknew no rights or laws. \n\n\"We came quickly  to his cave,  but did not find \nhim  inside,  as  he  was  off  tending  his  fat  sheep. \nWe  went  into  the  cave  and  looked  everything \nover. There we  found  baskets loaded with cheeses \nand  pens  crowded  full  of  sheep  and  goats.  The \nsheep  of different  ages  were  shut up  in  separate \nplaces;  in  one  there  were  spring  lambs;  in  an \nother,  summer  lambs,  and  in  a  third,  the  new \nhorn  lambs.  We  saw  there,  too,  the  well-made \ncrocks and  bowls  he used  for  milking,  everyone \nof  them  swimming  with  whey. \n\n\"My men  were begging me  to take some of the \ncheeses,  then  quickly  to  drive  some  sheep  and \ngoats  from  the  pens  and  go  back  and  sail  over \nthe  salt  sea.  But  I  did  not  listen  to  them-it \n\nwould  have been  much better if I  had !-because \nI wanted to see the creature and find  out whether \nhe would offer me gifts.

They lifted \nthe  sharp-pointed  club  and  pressed  it  into  his \neye,  while  I  pushed  down  on  it  and  turned  it \naround,  just  as  a  man  bores  through  a  ship's \ntimber  with  a  drill.  (His  helpers  below  whirl  it \naround  with  a  strap  that  they  pull  from  either \nside,  and  so  the  drill  keeps  steadily  turning  an \nthe  while.)  That's how  we  kept  turning  the fiery \npointed club in the Cyclops' eye. The blood flowed \nout around  the  hot wood,  and  the  blast from  the \nburning  eyeball  singed  his  lids  and  eyebrows, \nand  the  roots  of  his  eye  burst  in  the  heat.

He  roared  and  bellowed  in  agony  while \nthe  rocks  about  him  resounded  with  his  cries. \nWe  all  ran  from  him  in  terror. \n\n\"Then  he  pulled  the  blood-soaked  club  from \nhis eye, and mad with pain, flung  it from him.  In \na tremendous voice he called to the  Cyclopes who \nlived far above, in the caves on the windy heights. \nHearing  his  cries,  they  came  running  from  all \nsides,  and standing outside  around  his cave,  they \nasked  him  what  was  wrong.  'Polyphemus,  why \nare  you  so  desperate,  and  why  do  you  shout  so \nin  the  celestial  nighttime  and  keep  us  all  from \nsleep?  Is any man driving your  flocks  off  against \nyour will?  Is any man taking your life by trickery \nor  violence?'

You  can only  pray \nfor help from  your father,  Lord Poseidon.' \n\n\"With those words they went off,  and my heart \nlaughed  because  thanks  to  my  cleverness  the \nfalse  name  had  fooled  him.  The  Cyclops,  groan \ning  and  suffering  sharp  pangs  of  pain,  groped \nabout with his hands and took the stone from the \nentrance.  Then  he  sat  down  in  the  opening  and \nstretched  out  his  hands  to  see  if  he  could  catch \nanyone walking out among the sheep.

Here  is  the  plan  that  struck  me \nas  best.  The  rams  in  the  flock  were  well  fed,  big \nhandsome  fellows,  with  thick  coats  of  dark\u00b7 \nviolet wool.  Taking three at a  time, I  quietly tied \nthem  firmly  together  with  some  of  the  willow \ntwigs  on  which  the  monster  usually  slept.  The \nram  in  the  middle  carried  one  of  my  men  tied \nbeneath  him,  while  the  two  on  the  outside  went \nalong for protection. Thus there were three sheep \ncarrying  each  one  of  my  comrades.  For  myself, \nI  chose  a  ram  that  was  by  far  the  best  of  the \nwhole  flock.  Taking  hold  of  him  1 doubled  my\u00b7 \nself up  under his shaggy belly;  then with my face \nupwards  I  boldly  clung  tight  to  his  marvellous \nwool.  So  we  stayed  there,  unhappily  waiting  for \nmorning to come. \n\n\"When  Eos,  the  early  born,  the  rosy-fingered \ngoddess,  appeared,  the males  ran  out  to  pasture, \nbut the  females  stood  bleating about  the  pens,  as \nthey had not been  milked,  and their  udders  were \nalmost  bursting.  Their  master,  though  tortured \nby  cruel  pains,  ran  his  hands  over  the  back  of \nevery  sheep  as  it  came  and  stood  beside  him  on \nits  way  out.  Poor  fool,  he  did  not  understand \nthat  my  men  were  tied  under  the  bellies  of  his \nthick-fleeced  sheep!  Last  of all,  the  prize  ram  of \nthe  flock  came  walking  toward  the  entrance.  He \nhad been slowed down  by  his thick fleece  and  by \nthe  weight of  his tricky passenger. \n\n\"As he  ran  his  hands  over  him,  mighty  Poly. \nphemus  said,  'Good  old  fellow,  what  does  this \nmean?  Why are you  the lait of the  flock  to  leave \nthe cave ?  You  were  never left behind before, but \nyou  always went striding ahead  and were  always \nthe  first  to  be  grazing  on  the  lush  flowers  of  the \ngrass,  the  first  to  reach  the  flowing  streams,  and \nthe  first  to  want to return to  the  fold  at evening. \nBut today you are the last of all!  1 think you feel \nthe loss  of  your master's  eye,  which  was  put out \nby that bad man  and his cruel comrades.

We  quickly  drove  off \nthe fat slender-legged flocks,  often turning to  look \nback  until  we  finally  reached  the  ship.  Our  good \ncomrades  were  more  than  glad  to  see  all  of  us \nthat  had  escaped,  and  they  began  to  sob  and  cry \nfor  the  rest.

When  we  were  as  far  from  shore  as  a  loud \ncry  can  be  heard,  I  began  to  shout insults at the \nCyclops.  'Cyclops,'  1 said,  'you  see  I  was  not  so \nhelpless,  and  you  see  it was  not  meant  for  you  to \ngulp down my men with all your might and main! \nBut  it  was  meant  that  your  wicked  deeds  would \nfind  you  out, because you  were shameless enough \nto  eat  strangers  who  were  staying  in  your  own \nhouse.  So  Zeus  and the other gods have punished \nyou  well.' \n\n\"When he heard me, his anger grew even  more \nviolent,  and  he  broke  off  the  top  of  a  great \nmountain  and  flung  it  down  ahead  of  our  dark\u00b7 \nprowed  ship.  When  the  rock  struck,  the  sea  was \nforced  up  in  a  great wave  that  swelled  from  the \ndepths and carried the ship back to shore, driving \nit  up  on  the dry land.  But 1 grabbed a  long  pole \nand  pushed  her  off,  and  called  to  my  men  and \ntold  them to start rowing if we  were to avoid real \ntrouble.  My  looks  told  them that  I  meant  it;  and \nthey  fell  to  their oars and  rowed!  When  we  were \ntwice  as  far  out  as  before,  I  began  shouting  to \nthe  Cyclops  again,  though  my  men  stood  around \nme,  trying  one  after  another  to  soothe  me  and \nhold  me  back.  'You  poor  fool,'  they  said,  'why \ndo  you  want  to  bother  this  wild  man?  Just  now \nhe  flung  something  into  the  sea  that  drove  our \nship straight back to  shore again.

Odysseus \nand  his men  set sail  and reach  the Sirens' coast.] \n.. 'Friends,'  I  said  to  my  comrades,  'it  is  not \nright  for  only  one  or  two  of  us  to  know  the \nprophecies  that  the  goddess  Circe  made  to  me, \nso  I  shall  tell  them to all  of  you,  and  you  will  at \nany  rate  have  heard  them-whatever happens  to \nus,  whether  we  die  or whether  we  come  through \nsafely  without meeting death  and doom . \n\n.. 'She  warned  us  first  of  all  to  beware  of \nthe voices  and flowery  meadows of the wonderful \nSirens. I am the only one, she said, who is to hear \nthem  sing,  and  I  am  to  stand  on  the  mast block \nwhile  you  bind  me  with  ropes  tight to  the  mast \nso  that  I  must  surely stay  there  without moving. \nIf I beg  you  or even  order you  to let me  go,  you \nare to  tie  me  with  even  more  ropes than before.' \nSo I told my men all the prophecies and explained \nevery  single detail  of  them. \n\n\"In  the  meantime  our  well\u00b7built  ship  had \nreached the island of the Sirens, for a good breeze \nhad  been  carrying  her  quickly  along.  But  sud\u00b7 \ndenly  the  wind  fell,  and  there  was  a  breathless \ncalm.  Some  deity,  it  seemed,  had  put  the  waves \nto  sleep.  My  men  jumped  up,  lowered  the  sails \nand threw them in the hold, and then taking their \nplaces  they  struck  the  water  with  the  smooth \nblades  and  made  it white with  foam. \n\n\"When I had cut a large ball of wax into small \npieces with  my  sharp knife, I  pressed it firmly  in \nmy  hands,  and  the wax  quickly grew  warm  both \nfrom  the pressure and from  the bright rays of the \nsun.  Going  down  the  boat  from  one  man  to  an\u00b7 \nother, I smeared some of the wax over each one's \nears.  Next  I  stepped  up  on  the  mast\u00b7block,  and \nthey  bound  me  hand  and  foot  with  ropes  drawn \ntight about the mast.  Again they took their places \nand struck  the  grey sea with their  oars. \n\n\"We  were  about  as  far  from  shore  as  a  loud \nshout will carry and speeding rapidly along, when \nthe  Sirens  saw  our  swift  ship  coming  near  and \nbegan  to  sing  in  their  piercingly  clear  voices: \n'Come  here,  come  here,  famous  Odysseus,  glory \n\nof  the  Achaeans,  anchor  your  ship  and  stay  to \nhear  our  song.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f29fccf-6ddc-4cf9-9b72-dc8ac9213ace": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f29fccf-6ddc-4cf9-9b72-dc8ac9213ace", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 76, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5a9c81d-936e-45af-81a7-a47d4043508f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 76, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "8b186e45136b915a511d1a57686fdc012437d1ee8b668542eaacd6eb8f14e8e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e39b7643-81a8-489c-8403-0aa3e1818ca3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 76, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "e5deb864fce33525b385cc6b507a7b46d62d6d18c987aa23ee0bde9f9485cd99"}}, "hash": "10c14fcac6ed2a6cb4cc4be036dcf71d82c55d44ea884a7e5108e503c5000735", "text": "Never  yet  has  anyone passed  this \nway in his black ship without hearing the thrilling \nand  sweet  sounds  that  come  from  our  lips,  and \nonce  he  has  known  the  joy of  our song,  he  goes \non  his  way  with  a great treasure of wisdom.

The  swineherd  had  built  this  yard \nwhile  his  master  was  away,  without  any  help \nfrom  his  mistress  or  old  Laertes.  On  the  inside \nhe  had  lined  it with  quarried  stones  and topped \nthem  off  with  a  layer  of thorny  brushwood.  On \nthe outside, he had driven in stakes of split black \noak,  setting  them  close  together  all  the  way \naround.  Within  the  yard,  he  had  built  twelve \npens  close  together  as  shelters  for  his  pigs.  At \nnight  fifty  big  sprawling  sows  were  shut  up  in \neach  one,  while  the  boars  slept  outside.  There \nwere  many  fewer  boars  than  sows,  only  360  in \nall;  and  the  wicked  suitors  were  making  their \nnumbers  smaller  and  smaller  because  they  were \nalways  having  the  swineherd  send  up  the  very \nfattest  ones  for  their daily  feasts.  Near  by every \nnight slept four dogs, fierce  as wild beasts, which \nthe princely herdsman had bred. \n\nAs he sat there, he was cutting some sandals out \nof a stout piece of cowhide and fitting them to his \nfeet.  Three of his helpers had gone off  in various \ndirections to herd their swine;  the fourth  he had \nbeen  obliged  to  send  to  town  with  a  pig  for  the \narrogant  suitors  so  they  could  kill  it  and  have \ntheir fill  of meat. \n\nSuddenly the dogs saw Odysseus and ran down \non him howling and barking, but when they came \nclose  Odysseus  cleverly  crouched  down  and  let \nhis walking stick fall  from his hand.  But in spite \nof  his  cunning  he  might  very  well  have  been \ncruelly  hurt then  and there,  near his own  stock \nyard,  if the swineherd  had  not come  running to \nhelp  him.  Letting the leather fall  from  his hand, \nhe dashed through the gateway, and yelling at the \ndogs  and  flinging  a shower  of  stones  after them, \nhe sent them all running in different directions. \n\nThen  he  turned  to  his  master  and  said,  \"Old \nman,  my  dogs  came  within  a  little of doing  you \nin just now,  and if they had, you would have put \nthe blame on me.

No, not until I touched \nmy  master  with  my  hands,  not  until  then,  was  I \nsure!\" \n\nAs  she  spoke,  her  eyes  glanced  towards  Pe \nnelope,  for  she wanted to  show  her that her dear \nin  his  own  house.  But \nhusband  was \nPenelope  could  not  look  toward  her  or take  any \nnotice  because  Athena  had  turned  her  thoughts \nelsewhere. \n\nthere \n\nBefore  Eurycleia  could \n\nspeak,  Odysseus \ngrabbed  her  by  the  throat  with  his  right  hand, \nand  with  the  other  drew  her  closer  to  him  and \nsaid,  \"Dear  woman,  do  you  want  to  ruin  me! \nYou  know  that  you  nursed  me  at  your  breast; \nknow  too that after enduring many sufferings for \nover  nineteen  years  I  have  at  last  come  to  the \nland  of  my  fathers.  But  since  some  god  has  put \nthe thought in your heart and you have seen  who \nI  am,  keep  still,  for  fear  someone  else  may  find \nout,  too.  Otherwise,  let  me  tell  you  what  will \nhappen:  if some  god  lets  me  kill  the  suitors,  I \nwon't spare  you,  even  though  you  are my  nurse, \nwhen  I  kill the  rest  of the serving women  in this \nhouse.\" \n\nThen  thoughtful  Eurycleia  said  to  him:  \"My \nchild,  what  a  thing  for  you  to  say!  You  know \nhow firm  and unyielding my spirit is: I will stand \nfast  like  a  solid  block  of  stone  or  iron.  But  one \nthing I  shall tell  you,  and  don't  forget  it,  either. \nIf some  god  lets  you  kill  the  suitors,  I  shall  go \nover the names of all the women in the house and \ntell  you  which  ones  are  a  disgrace  to  you  and \nwhich  are innocent.\" \n\nResourceful  Odysseus  answered  her  and  said: \n\"Why speak of them?  You hardly need to. I shall \nwatch  them  closely  myself  and  know  what  each \none  of them  is  like.  But  keep  from  talking,  and \nleave  everything to the gods.\" \n\nWhen  he  had  finished,  the  old  woman  went \nthrough  the  hall  to  fetch  some  more  water  to \nwash  his  feet,  because  all  the  other  had  spilled \nout.  When  she  had  washed  him  and rubbed  him \nwith  oil,  Odysseus  drew  his  chair  closer  to  the \n\nfire and carefully covered his scar with his ragged \n[ 465--507] \nclothes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed652852-f978-486f-8c66-eb565255368c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed652852-f978-486f-8c66-eb565255368c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 80, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e85c556b-a569-4571-ac6a-86d9ae6046e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 80, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "f802123360c39dd5c043361b9363970b2a9260b157e2b0e509e70dfd78957149"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6d35104-567a-4167-9777-77e0491db64d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": 80, "file_name": "termtest1.pdf"}, "hash": "23ef2b69c8ef5c999100a96875271b385fe248473d8899d5997cf15a1d40b423"}}, "hash": "154c713ef74f7211058eca14ac3b932688565a1aeb38b7a50dcbc8abe34f5500", "text": "[Penelope  confides  to  the  supposed  stranger \nher  misgivings  and  recounts  to  him  a  strange \ndream  she  had  the  night before.

He  spread  out an  untanned  ox hide \nand  over  that  many  fleeces  from  sheep  that  the \nAchaeans  had  killed  for  their  feasts.  When  he \nhad lain down, the maid Eurynome threw a cloak \nover  him. \n\nOdysseus  lay  there  wide  awake,  his  mind  full \nof  plans  for  punishing  the  suitors.  The  women \nof the  house,  who  had long  been the suitors' mis\u00b7 \ntresses,  came  out  of  the  hall laughing and  joking \nwith  each  other.  When  Odysseus  heard  them  he \ngrew  violently  angry,  and  he  wondered  whether \nhe  should  jump up and  strike  them  dead  now  or \nwhether  he  should  let  them  sleep  with  the  arro\u00b7 \ngant  suitors  for  one  last  time.  His  heart  was \nfairly  howling  with  fury.  As  a  dog,  seeing  a \nstranger,  walks  around  her  helpless  puppies  and \nbarks and gets ready to  fight, so his heart howled \nwith  anger  at their  wicked  acts. \n\nHe  struck  his  breast  and  scolded  himself  in \nthese  words:  \"Bear  up,  my  heart!  You  once  en \ndured  something  still  more  vile  than  this  on  the \nday  when  the  Cyclops  with  irresistible  fury  ate \nmy  strong comrades.  But  you  bore  up  until  my \ncleverness  brought  you  out  of  the  cave,  though \nyou  thought  you  were  doomed  to  die.\" \n\nSo  he  talked  to  himself,  and  his  heart  obeyed \nand  remained  brave  and  unshaken.  But  still  he \nkept  tossing  this  way  and  that  on  his  bed.  As  a \nman  holds  a  sausage  stuffed  with  fat  and  blood \nover a great blazing fire and turns it now this way \nand  now  that  in  his  eagerness  to  get  it  roasted \nquickly,  so  Odysseus  tossed  and turned.  He kept \nwondering  how  he  alone,  one  against  many, \ncould  get  his  hands  on  the  shameless  suitors. \n\nAt  once  Athena  came  down  from  the sky  and \nappeared  beside  him  in  the  form  of  a  woman. \nAs  she  stood  looking  down  at  him,  she  said, \n\n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/2/2023 4:08 PM via UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO.

In time  to \ncome  you  will  suffer  bitterly  if  you  kill  a  bard, \nfor  like  all  singers  I  honor  both  gods  and  men. \nNo  one  else  taught  me,  a god  made  all  kinds  of \nsongs  grow and flower  in my  mind;  and if I live \nyou  will hear me singing to  you  as  if you were a \ngod. \n\n\"So do not kill me!  Your dear son Telemachus \ncan  tell  you  that  I  did  not come here of my  own \nfree will to sing for the suitors at their feasts, and \nI  did  not  come  for  money  either.  They  got  me \nhere  only  because  there  were  so  many  of  them \nand  they  were  so  much stronger than  I.n \n\nGood Telemachus heard his words with respect \nand quickly spoke to his father, who was standing \nnear  by,  \"Stop!  Don't strike this  innocent man! \nAnd  save  Medon  the  herald,  too,  because  when \nI  was  a  boy  he  was  always  my  protector  here. \nBut Philetius or the swineherd  may have already \nkilled  him,  or  perhaps  you  ran  into  him  when \nyou  went storming through the hall.\" \n\nMedon,  a very  shrewd  fellow,  had  heard  these \nwords  from  where  he  lay  safely  hidden.  He  had \nescaped  harm  by  crouching  under  a  chair  and \nwrapping himself  in a  freshly\u00b7flayed  ox hide. He \nnow  quickly  threw  off  the  hide  and  suddenly \ndarted out from  under  the  chair.  Running up to \nTelemachus,  he clasped  his  knees  and  asked  him \nfor  mercy, \"My friend,  here  I  am!  Stop fighting \nnow  and  save  me!  Your father's  strength  is tre\u00b7 \nmendous; tell him not to strike me simply because \nhe  is  angry  at  the  suitors!  They  were  the  ones, \nand  not  I, who  wasted  his  wealth  and  who  were \nfoolish  enough  to  have  no  respect  for  you.\" \n\nResourceful  Odysseus  smiled  at him and said, \n\"Cheer up,  my  son  has  protected  you  and saved \nyou.  Now  you  will  be  able  to  understand  and \ntell  others  that  well\u00b7doing  is  much  better  than \n\n EBSCOhost - printed on 10/2/2023 4:08 PM via UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO.

This \nwas a moment as happy for her as when swimmers \nfrom  a  shipwreck  first  catch  sight  of  land.  The \nwind  and  heavy  seas  have  struck their  well-built \nboat,  and  Poseidon  has  dashed  it  to  pieces,  but \na few  of them escape from the grey sea by swim \nming  to  the  shore.

She  clung \nto him and could not let him go. \n\nAnd  Eos,  the  rosy-fingered  goddess  of  morn \ning,  would  surely  have  found  them  still  weeping \nif  gleaming-eyed  Athena  had  not  planned  things \ndifferently.  First she  held  Night  back  for  a  long \ntime in his journey over the earth; next, she made \nEos  stay  by  Ocean's  stream  and  would  not  let \nher hitch up swift Lampus and Phaethon, the colts \nthat  carry  the  goddess  and  bring  the  morning \nlight to  men. \n\nThen  resourceful  Odysseus  said  to  Penelope: \n\"My  wife,  we  have  not  yet  come  to  the  end  of \nall  our troubles,  but there will  be  one more trial, \nan  immeasurably  great  and  difficult  one,  that  I \nmust  go  through.
